Dumbledore becomes aware of the plot and confronts Malfoy, offering him a chance to back out and revealing the true extent of the danger and moral implications of his actions. However, Malfoy ultimately decides to go through with the assassination attempt, leading to a confrontation between Dumbledore and Malfoy.

clear and specifics were given by usf if they wanted to be so stringent on how policy should be rebalanced we originally had 520 eth cover and premium paid in full till may 9th out of which only 400 eth cover was paid out so saying that cover was paid out in full is factually not accurate after the rebalancing we made our total cover from 520 to 680 eth across two policies for ust depeg event of which only 400 eth is claimed 1217 is rejected by saying it's a panic buy that means the cover was added when depeg already started by that logic when depeg started we had 520 eth cover and only 400 eth was paid out in any insurance case if the terms and conditions of the policy are not clear it is generally granted in favor of the insured as the insured don't have any say in defining tc this case is for everyone to see how usf purposefully writes ambiguous policy documentation and finds every nook corner to deny the cases when an insured event has happened no written policy rules were violated and that remains the undisputed truth ruling in 1217 was nothing but unacceptable since kleros' founder attacked the court and hijacked the 51 votes to rule on the case at his own discretion one can dispute the events of the case are arguable but cannot dispute the fact that a fair hearing was not provided in the 1217 case if the outcome of 1217 was by fair transparent and independent jurors who do not have conflict of interest we would have accepted the judgement and respected it also please note case 1217 is sub judice now and court filings have already begun we do not plan to appeal and fund the corrupt kleros juror system anymore and that's why case was not appealed however we did make one last good faith attempt to settle the case and put this behind us by reducing the amount of eth and just asking for total eth cover for ust depeg event for which premium was paid in full up until may 9th however completely opposite of what happens in real world insurance cases usf and kleros have relied on denying all disputable cases with brute force attacks on the court one can deny or accept the case however attacking the claimant who is merely trying to avail the service for which heshe paid for in full is preposterous this is not the first time the kleros system has relied on making attacks on the claimants itself who are fighting for their side of the story to avail the service they were promised and paid for in full same thing happened in case 1170 this should be noted for future public records we understand the 120 eth cover was on anchor ust policy and this token is for ust policy these tokens would not have been on ust policy if rebalancing rules were clear in the first place if usf wanted us to rebalance in a certain way they could have easily provided the instructions but they failed to do so fact remains cover was for ust depeg at the end of the day and the claim is made against ust depeg event despite technicalities of the case fact remains we had 520 eth cover at minimum for ust depeg event and for which usf capital suppliers enjoyed the premium in whole this was our last good faith attempt to put this behind us however considering the

court even if we were to entertain the notion of a rebalancing across the ust and terra anchor ust policies the following facts stand out credible concern about a potential ust depeg was already making the news the day before the socalled rebalancing and ust had depegged by around 1 already the ust policy is naturally cheaper than the anchor ust policy since it is more restricted in its scope with the former being almost twice as cheap as the latter the claimant still had most of their ust in the anchor platform at the time of switching policies and kept it there for weeks thereafter which makes it strange that they would suddenly and without ulterior motive wish to switch to a policy not covering that smart contract risk it is therefore likely that the claimant aware of the broader market's concerns decided to rebalance their cover at that specific time which in itself would be fine and saw an opportunity to reduce their insurance costs by a small amount by switching to the cheaper policy covering only their main concern at the time ust depegging this is barely worth mentioning but the claimant's latest claim that challenges must be made within 2 days of the claim being filed is obviously absurd since the weeklong challenge window exists for the sole purpose of allowing challenges the evidence provided is a link to documentation which is clearly outdated and has no contractual weight in the first place in conclusion if the claimant had rebalanced from the strictly more restricted ust policy to the more expensive anchor ust policy it would be fair albeit somewhat unconventional to accept this claim related to ust depegging however since the claimant switched to a cheaper policy and it appears that they did so only in order to cheap out on the insurer in

caused and cost incurred and the challenger’s request of reimbursement for fees and gas is very reasonable and fair i would be happy to accept the proposal and complete the transfer i am not sure how to proceed here whether there is a process to be followed to formally accept the offer as it seems was done in case 1201 where i wait until voting and we go through it there or if i should just send the challenger’s wallet the payment and submit proof of that as evidence beforehand'}, '4': {'title': 'link to proof of ownership transaction update from previous pdf', 'description': 'proof of

previously addressed the challengers’ points but i would like to take this opportunity as recommended by pablo and clement of the kleros community to address the jurors on why my claim is valid and should be fully compensated i understand that each juror has their own perspective and opinions so i would like to bring up a few points for consideration i firmly believe my claim is valid as i have met all the conditions as stated in the policy starting from ust ownership prior to policy start a valid policy past the depeg event and proof of loss i am not entirely sure what each juror's viewpoints are regarding the interpretation of the policy i am not here to say anyone is wrong in their views but i would like to also point out my viewpoints are also not wrong for the following reasons 1 the policy was written to be broad since the team has acknowledged it is difficult to account for every scenario that is possible especially if it has not yet occurred 2 the policy was written and i quote what’s insured any ust or aust assets or any debtborrowing positions held on a centralized decentralized exchange a terra wallet or any other blockchain wallet of which ownership prior to the policy period can be proven through deposits message signing trading activity any onchain transactions or other verifiable means this tells me the intent is to cover the ust depegging loss in any form the ust token itself aust assets and any debtborrowing positions that could be stored on a centralizeddecentralized exchange or any other blockchain wallet if we can prove ownership my situation may not be as common as the other claimants but it is still specifically listed as one of the covered conditions under the policy wording debtborrowing positions clause i have also met the other 3 main requirements to be eligible which is a loss related to the ustus depeg the twap event that has occurred which i am sure everyone can agree that ust will not be repegging and my loss did in fact occur during the policy period i believe the only point of contention is my debtborrowing position to which i would like to emphasize it is clearly stated as covered according to the policy document and that the policy makes no mention that there should be any special considerations for debtborrowing positions just like in the case of 1208 and 1212 where they were challenged due to the luna2 airdrop however the jurors were just and honest and voted to approve those two claims as the policy document made no mention that any airdropscompensation would impact their claim so to be consistent with that line of thinking my claim is also valid since the policy document contains clear criteria for claim eligibility and does not make any mention of exceptions regarding debtborrowing positions either it is simply listed as one of the covered scenarios the policy document cannot be modified after an event especially during a claim and since my claim meets all of the criteria clearly laid out in the policy that i purchased force majeure cannot apply to my claim either the principle of contra proferentem applies in which the courts interpret ambiguous terms in a coverage policy against the coverage provider in favor of the policyholder this rule originates from the fact that coverage policies consist of nonnegotiable language set forth by the coverage provider it has been long established that the rule of contra proferentem applies with even greater force where the ambiguity occurs in an exclusion because the burden of proof lies not with the claimant but with the coverage provider to show where the exclusion applies a notable example of integrity and ruling in favor of the claimant was when nexus mutual paid out over 1000 eth to a claimant with no actual losses because the policy did not stipulate they must suffer a loss just that they had to have a valid policy and to meet every other condition listed in the policy and the claim was paid out i do believe that unslashed finance has potential with their novel idea of the spartan bucket which minimizes the losses a capital supplier would lose in the event of claims and that disputes would be resolved through kleros for fair and just arbitration since this policy has ambiguity this would be an opportunity for the kleros court to demonstrate to the community that it will always honor contra proferentem just like any bonafide court system in this case since there is no exclusion that losses from debtborrowing positions would be considered and compensated differently than any other ust or aust asset losses it would not be just or fair to assume that it would be covered differently since it is not stated in the policy if this claim is approved then it would instill confidence for people with considerably larger portfolios and funds than myself to go with unslashedkleros as their coverage provider and arbitrator since its practices would align with the practices from courts of law this would positively result in greater revenue for capital suppliers and larger cases and fees to the kleros jurors in the event of a dispute this last month has been a tough time for everyone involved the claimants the capital suppliers and the jurors but i hope we can all work hard to put this all behind us i have provided clear reasons and evidence to accept the claim due to meeting all of the requirements as laid out in the policy if any of the jurors have any questions i will be glad to address them thank you for your time and consideration""}, '10':

api secret can not be considered verifiable means and as such the claim must be rejected ownership on terra address prior to depeg can not guarantee the claimant did not sell ust at higher prices and thus can't guarantee that the amount is not inflated the correct way here would be to reject this incomplete claim ceding original 0722 eth to the challenger then use unslashed adjust claim amount

this would require another 0722 eth deposit which would upon accept return back to the claimant in total the claimant stands to lose 0722 eth and the challenger stands to gain that amount minus 022 that the challenger paid for the kleros dispute this would be the correct flow of such claim and this is why it's not about 022 eth but about 0722 eth which the challenger was hunting for in the previous settlement proposal the challenger asked to perform this transfer of 0722 eth right away to save time at this moment the challenger understands that although this would save claimant's time it's not 100 guaranteed that jurors will vote reject and thus for the settlement it would be better to offer a lower amount so that the claimant stands to gain something from accepting the settlement

to lose if the claim goes by its normal flow the challenger gets back 25 less than they expected but is sure of the outcome and doesn't have to take a chance with the kleros court i hope the claimant sees it as a fair proposal this time and understands that by accepting it they gain some money back compared with what they would normally stand to lose for their mistake to the jurors a transfer of

dispute was created in the kleros court the cover policy clearly states that “the policy begins after an initial waiting period of 10 days” the claim was made for alleged “losses” which occurred in the first 28 hours of insurance purchase therefore the policy had not begun since the initial 10 day waiting period had not elapsed hence the premature claim must be rejected mr eisenberg further claims that at the time of purchase the specific insurance cover policy was absent and the label “coming soon” was displayed on the unslashed insurance marketplace website the cover policy as indicated to buyers was soon updated and was available by the time the dispute was created kleros general court policy clearly states that jurors should base their rulings on court policies as they “exist at the time of the creation of the dispute” therefore any reasonable interpretation of the case derives its rules from the cover policy document moreover mr eisenberg bought the insurance with

behave as intended or i do think that may is here used as a polite form of should in the spirit of the policy it means that the claim will be rejected we therefore disagree with mizu's argument that it should be read as it may be rejected we therefore put aside the policy period as the claimant waited weeks before getting the actual wave's vires usdn policy we still think we should reject the

transferring fiat money to and out of the blockchain so no smart contract is involved except for the mintingburningtransfer of usdn and this was working indeed the claimant received 6199308 usdn ie

when this claim was first made on apr 6th the policy with a waiting period was not publicly available i provided multiple pieces of evidence for this including a chat with the unslashed ceo asking for the policy which he repeatedly refused to provide and a screenshot of the ui showing the link to the pdf was broken while several of the evidence submissions claim that this policy was available earlier not a single one of them offers any evidence for this claim i encourage anyone curious about this to join the unslashed discord and read through the discussion prior to apr 6th which makes it clear it was not available at that time nor at the time the insurance was purchased by voting to reject this claim on the basis of this document that was not available at the time you would be destroying trust in kleros as an objective arbitrator that users could trust to handle disputes users would need to worry that new documents would be created and ruled by kleros to retroactively apply causing them to not only lose the case but also lose their bond and court fees that were paid in good faith this case has so many reasons to be rejected that it's hard to be concise the first and most obvious reason to reject this claim is that there was no incident according to customer support the gateway worked in standard mode actually even mizu chat with the customer support evidence provided by the claimant indicates that some transactions may be subject to additional security processing this is a standard security measure any transaction can be sent for additional processing for security purposes i previously submitted a screenshot showing waves support saying the maximum bridge time is one hour choosing to ignore that in favor of more recent statements after this high profile bridge delay is motivated reasoning the kleros rules ask for jurors to consider the primary document and state of the world at the time of dispute creation which points to a document excluding the loss as not being within the cover period and being due to external outputs even if you believe that the old coming soon document would apply this document would reference the new document not the absence of any exclusions even if you believe that the old coming soon does not refers to the new one this document would not provide any cover of the bridge as the bridge is not mentioned in this document nor in ui nor in the title of the insurance without the new document there would be no basis for bridge coverage contrary vires and usdn which are present in the ui and insurance title again you are choosing to ignore the evidence submitted that unslashed promoted this insurance policy as covering the bridge the potential delays are explicitely mentioned in the terms of services here a customer support representative indicated that the transaction was flagged for security due to it's high amount over 1 000 000 and the fact the addresses and funds are linked to an exit scam that the claimant himself committed it is very likely that the delay was due to claimant immoral acts and he is was lucky that the funds were ultimaltely processed and not sized please note that the suggestion any exit scam took place is wrong a redemption was carried out in march allowing all holders the opportunity to exit please see and for on chain evidence and and for details on the votes that authorized this redemption please also note that this conspiracy theorizing about why the bridge was unavailable is directly contradicted by the fact that multiple other people had issues with the bridge on the same day see eg and there was clearly a more widespread unavailability issue not the speculative theory they offer with little evidence the claimant didn't lose any fund by using the bridge he put some usdn in he got the right amount of usdn out no assets were lost the claimant strategy borrowing usdn and selling it which is shorting usdn led him to 465 057 of profit if the bridge had been faster he could have gotten a few thousands more but if the bridge was not there he couldn't have executed this strategy as there wasn't enough liquidity on waves of his own admission the bridge worked and allowed the claimant to make huge profits with his strategy so any loss he is claiming there is not a real loss but only a loss of opportunity he would have had would the bridge have been faster this is false they only count transactions on the eth side but not on the waves side as of now i've put more money in than i've gotten out please note if the bridge had not existed then i would not have deposited usdc and borrowed usdn at all since i would not have been able to sell the usdn and then i would not have lost any funds using this strategy they also suggest elsewhere that i should have repaid the usdn and waited to recover my usdc however that would have been a highly risky strategy since there was no guarantee that usdc liquidity would ever come back and in fact as of now vires has implemented strict withdraw limits to prevent users like me from withdrawing their capital had i followed the strategy suggested here i would have lost an additional million dollars in vires in a manner i have no doubt 0x177b would argue is uninsurable were i to try to file a claim on it now the suggestion that i didn't really lose money because i could have followed a different strategy that would have led to a complete loss in reality seems absurd the delay of 28h is pretty low both by classic financial system standard blockchain bridge standard or exchange withdrawal standard this has already been addressed the amount claimed for a delay is way too high even if jurors were to agree to a compensation a fair compensation would have been the cost of capital how much it would have cost to borrow the usdn for this period or the yield the usdn would have generated giving a compensation on what the claimant could have done if the bridge was faster doesn't make sense as it would require speculating on what the claimant would have done jurors believing this to be the case should reject the claim and then accept the readjusted one no speculation is required i am simply comparing the dollar value at the time the bridge was initiated to the dollar value at the time it was completed now even if you disagreed with all of the above the compensation calculation isn't still right this is due to the fact that the claimant didn't have enough cover to cover all the funds in vires the bridge the claimant had at least 9 251 917 of usdc in vires when the bridge finished while having only 1 000 eth of cover 3 282 000 according to ui which specifies note that if you suffered a loss on an exposure higher than your cover your loss will be recalculated proportionally in case of overexposure loss has to be calculated proportionally so the compensation should be at least there may be more exposure i haven't looked at divided by 925917 328000 281 leading to at most 51 281 181 eth of compensation jurors believing this should reject the claim and then accept the readjusted one the ui did not state this at the time the insurance was purchased nor at the time the claim was made i am unable to find it in the current ui if even after that you had rejected all the previous arguments the amount would still not be correct he sold usdn for 0995 the day of the alleged incident but he actually sold way more decreasing the price down to 0989 so even if he had gotten a better price for the bridged funds he would have gotten a worse price for the other usdn he sold himself so the total loss would have been 09890979100000310 000 only 23 of what he claimed so the claim would need to be rejected and only the readjsuted claim accepted this is making assumptions about liquidity in a hypothetical that are purely speculative the price went down over time which is why a working bridge was essential to my strategy again the simplest and most natural way to calculate loss is by looking at market prices at the time in fact if the bridge had been working properly i would likely have done many of my swaps earlier while usdn was priced higher and thereby saved significantly more than the 52 eth claimed since i had to wait on each amount bridged in order to loop further i would have been able to finish the entire looping process over several hours instead of multiple days

page warns users when they try to withdraw a token which doesn't have enough liquidity however what i found is even more interesting the transaction was flagged by a neural network machine learning algorithm they use to detect suspicious transactions and sent for additional security processing my belief is that the transaction was flagged due it being a high amount linked to accounts involved in the fortress dao exit scam indeed it was possible to trace back avraham the claimant and the fortress dao exit scammer wallet to the incident it's likely that the exit scam was reported and that the security technology that the wavesexchange uses took this reports into account and sent the transaction for additional processing finally the transaction was still processed probably after a manual review note that even if you don't believe that avraham exit scammed the fact that people reported it as such would likely have been taken into account by the transaction flagging algorithm moreover

protocol missbehaved in some way it's up to him to request some payment via classic legal means as kleros has no jurisdiction nor technical power unslashed can always change its contract logic in

disputes as asked by dapps using kleros or do they prefer to be on the side of a kleros disregarding those and ruling how they want in an unpredictable manner” for me the answer is the former please note that what i am asking is to enforce public marketing from unslashed and the public documents that were available the other side is asking to enforce a document that was private and that the ceo repeatedly refused to give me access to when requested that is itself an immoral act why would they refuse to upload the document they claim governs here until after this case was created if kleros were to reward such gamesmanship it would destroy trust in any protocols using kleros as users would justifiably be concerned that the documents applying to their claims could change at any moment including after cases began i would consider this argument facially absurd if not for the fact that multiple users appear to be endorsing it it would certainly never fly in a real court or arbitration

more usdc which required waiting for the bridge to complete selling usdn and then bridging in usdc i did not have access to usdn to sell while waiting for the bridge in fact looking at the screenshot posted you can see that the 405k usdn was deposited about an hour and a half after the previous usdn bridge was finally sent through i sold it for usdc bridged and deposited the usdc to vires and then borrowed more usdn to continue with the leveraged strategy note that i could not have simply repaid the usdn and withdrawn my usdc to avoid a loss because vires did not have liquidity for usdc withdraws at the time which was why the interest rate was so high making this strategy attractive see and which shows that all the usdc was borrowed out the only viable option was selling the received

token is still listed as mainframe on binance uniswap etherscan and all the other minor exchanges this can’t just be an oversight since the rebranding happened months ago so the proper and most commonly used name for the token is still mainframe the fact that the project rebranded does not mean that the token name has to change too the token used by the protocol is still the old mainframe token and it will be until the swap is done the rebranding happened in february 2020 as the submitter says but the token is still listed as “mainframe” everywhere making that the most commonly used

new version of these inverse synths but we don’t the synths submitted are the most recent versions of the token and as such the one that should be listed in the tcr this point can only be valid if and when a new version of these synths is live 3 the challenger also says “have you actually tried swapping any of these submitted frozen inverse synths to other synths i did and none of your submissions can be swapped only ibtc as what the synth monitoring link i sent was about” the challenger is claiming that he tried swapping these inverse synths but was been unable to do so i find that very hard to believe for a few reasons first of all only people that already own the asset could have done the swap as we saw in the previous pieces of evidence the chances of the challenger having some are low but if that was the case i am sure that he could point us to his wallet and transaction where he tried to do these swaps but most importantly if we go by snx documentation the challenger claim is clearly false since you can swap the assets back to other synths or susd even if frozen otherwise what would be the point of such an asset that if the price moves too much you are stuck with it forever and unable to redeem it snx is clear on this and quoting their documentation “if it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen it will no longer be able to be purchased on synthetixexchange but can still be traded for other synths at its frozen value” this leaves no doubts the asset can still be redeemed for susd or swapped to other synths the only frozen thing is its value and issuance

tenant should not be held responsible for the damage as part of the lease's terms a functional ie working without any issue or limitation washing machine was to be furnished for use by the tenant the washing machine provided had been installed and in use presumably by prior occupants of the apartment for a period of no less than two to three years this is assuming the washing machine was brand new at the time it was put in place in 2017 when the building itself was constructed for all we know it may even be older than that as no further information on the appliance is provided based on this we can assume that the tenant is in no way responsible for and wear and tear derived from normal usage of the washing machine prior to his leasing the apartment we can also assume based on these facts that the tenant also had no way of truly knowing history true condition and age of the washing machine prior to leasing the apartment in 2020 several years into the functioning lifespan of the washing machine itself while most washing machines have effective lifespans ranging from 5 to 15 years this can vary tremendously based on the type brand frequency of use and whether or not users place additional stress on the unit most often from laundry loads exceeding the machine's recommended weight tolerances this matters in the context of what i stated above where the tenant in our dispute could not possibly be attributed any responsibility for what the appliance may have been put through before the tenant leased the apartment and thus assumed responsibility from that point going forward for using the appliance responsibly while 3 years possibly more possibly less into a washing machine's serviceable lifespan is far from the point of nearing end of life status it is in all likelihood well past the expiration of the original manufacturer's warranty and well into to usage window where regular expected preventative maintenance and minor repairs may need to be done to keep the machine in proper working order to satisfy the terms of the lease requiring a washing machine in proper working order this line of reasoning should not be considered overly speculative of controversial in the context of this case or the facts presented herein now to the matter of the malfunction of the washing machine itself that caused the damages to the apartment buildingunits the company that manages the building on behalf of the landlord conducted their own preliminary investigation and stated without any further clarification that the cause of the accident was a malfunctioning washing machine they did not assign any blame for appliance's malfunction beyond the appliance itself and certainly did not lay any responsibility for the malfunction at the feet of the tenant who was not even specifically mentioned in the report itself at the conclusion of the report the building management company did recommend that another presumably more comprehensive inspection be conducted on the washing machine which was subsequently performed by the building's handyman as well as a technician hired by the landlord it was not explained or submitted into evidence what kind of technician was hired or whether or not he was adequately experienced and qualified in evaluating repairing or otherwise working with washing machines i will set aside the fact for now that both of the individuals conducting the followup inspection were being employedfinancially compensated by the landlord rather than the tenant and thus both have an obvious and demonstrable conflict of interest in how they assess the causal nature of the washing machine malfunction an analysis that ultimately renders the tenant blameless and consequently results in the landlord having to pay the full cost of the repairs could easily lead to punishment from the landlord in the form of lost future employment opportunities and loss of income i am not accusing the landlord the handyman or the technician of any dishonesty or malfeasance in this matter but given the lack of detail provided in the prevailing facts of the case it is definitely a cause for concern ideally the tenant should have hired his own technician with his own money and had a separate independent inspection of the washing machine conducted to balance out the two inspections conducted by the landlord's two experts while conflicts of interest would still remain on both sides at least there would have been more useful information to work with in terms of diagnosing how and why the appliance malfunctioned and jurors could fairly and more appropriately evaluate each inspection's credibility unfortunately the tenant did not do this and it is too late for him to do so thus we must work with what we have i said earlier that i will set aside issues of conflicting interests in the additional inspection reports because even after taking that into account based on the reports provided by the landlord's own representatives more specifically the handyman and the technician the landlord is unable to prove that the tenant was the root cause for the washing machine's failure and therefore liable for the building's repair costs to be paid for out of the bondsecurity deposit provided by the tenant at the beginning of the lease the technician's report stated that soap suds and a paperclip were found in the washer no further clarification was provided as to the specific nature or origin of the soapsuds was it laundry detergent regular soap something else considering that washing machines by design utilize many varieties cleaning agents the observed presence of soap suds without any further contextual information is an ambiguous and unhelpful detail also know colloquially as a red herring furthermore it was stated that the tenant had been using the washer for several months prior to the incident without any issues and thus presumably knows the proper sort of detergentcleaning solution to use for washing machines and it should be noted that the landlord did not attempt to claim or prove anything to the contrary next anybody who has ever used a washing machine probably already knows that the presence of a single paperclip in a load of laundry is likely not enough to cause a malfunction in the washer's regular operation at all much less a malfunction on the level of the one that occurred in this scenario such an implication on the part of the landlord's technician is borderline preposterous the technician's report stated that the leak could not be replicated this may be useful later on for diagnostic purposes but does not prove anything in terms of who or what is responsible for the leak that caused damage to the building if it can't provide credible insight into the cause of the leak then it cannot be used as a basis for assigning liability for said leak the tenant claims that the during the inspections the technician did not bother to pull out the machine from it's original physical position and manually or visually inspect the pipeconnections where water enters the appliance the landlord does not dispute this claim by the tenant considering that this entire issue centers around a water leak for an appliance technician to fail to thoroughly assess this fundamentally critical area is baffling any appliance inspection report insinuating responsibility for an water leak without having actually inspected the parts where the water leak by definition must have occurred is worthless and thus its claims can be dismissed as worthless for the purposes of this dispute in conclusion the landlord has failed to demonstrate convincingly that the tenant is in any way sufficiently liable for the the appliance's failure and the resulting water leak the preponderance of evidence indicates that the tenant acted reasonably and in a manner that is compliant with the agreed upon terms of the apartment lease concerning use and care of appliances the tenant did not act negligibly or in such a way that would render him liable for the resulting damages and thus the landlord cannot void the tenant's right to receive back the full amount of his

it all at once here the content is the same part 1 this first post of perhaps several is in response to the challenger’s most recent comments i have been following all four aave token cases 536 537 538 and 539 as well as your challenges to the token removal requests from the very beginning you can wave your money around and arrogantly demean and threaten people all you want but that does not make your claims any more legitimate or believable plenty of jurors and third parties across all four cases have articulated why your position is fundamentally flawed and borderline dishonest and provided much more comprehensive counterarguments than you have to demonstrate support for their side rather than address those counterarguments point by point and refute them because you can’t you casually and hubristically ignore them altogether and instead copypaste the same comments over and over again hoping that enough people here are not engaged enough to notice what you are trying to pull the “evidences” that you have submitted on your own behalf not only do not sufficiently prove what you are ultimately trying to claim but upon close examination actually undermine the very claims you are trying to make anybody who takes the time and effort to carefully crossreference and examine all the submitted evidence will see that your entire position relies on poor reasoning selfishness and a deliberate disregard for common sense i will post more refutations to previous comments soon but in the meantime i encourage all jurors to read the lengthy justification statements previous jurors on the proremoval side have provided for their votes in cases 537 538 and 539 there have been attempts to enter those arguments into the evidence record for prior to voting for everyone to consider but thus far such efforts have been stymied by the limitations of the kleros court system interface in any case i have copied these arguments which quite thoroughly destroy the comparatively shallow points made the antiremoval side and attached them to this comment so that if others are unable to view them in courtklerosio they can download the file and read them for themselves line by line response to the post “argument against removal no” first a uniswap user uses the contract address to search for the token to swap arguably false as anyone who opens up the uniswap app can see that the search menu states search name or paste address considering that the name and not the specific contract address is first and foremost what people will likely use when searching for the token as it is shorter easier to remember and more publicly known hence the reason for having names for contract addresses in the first place two different addresses with the same nameticker is both duplicative and confusing the presumption that uniswap users automatically know what to do is a silly and unjustifiable stretch of the imagination how would an aave user automatically know which contract address is the one they are supposedly looking for where do they find this information if not in the registries and apps like t2cr where these tokens are listed this is akin to expecting users who are not as intimately familiar with these projects as the developers are to be able to either read minds or do burdensome levels of research and verification before utilizing token registries which of course negates the point of having curated registries in the first place evidently previous token will be replaced as soon as presented this statement is directly contradicted by the screenshot of the statements of bigmike and pablo candela already submitted into evidence which indicates both tokens will be active alongside each other for an indeterminate amount of time thus one is not merely replacing the other outright there will be two tokens listed for people to see how would having them appear in the lists with identical namestickerslogos not duplicative and therefore potentially confusing for people who don't know which one is which and given the fact that it shares the same name with the newer version as i will explain in further detail below this is a completely irrelevant consideration what's the point of resubmitting it with 'v1' or 'old' and adding v2 for new oneswhen v1 will fade away soon as proven earlier according to the team behind the tokens v1 will not be fading away soon the point of resubmitting with different names is to avoid duplicate token listings so that users are not tricked into accidentally buying incorrect or illiquid assets a possible scenario which is acknowledged by the screenshot of the text conversation between marc zeller and santiago koki already submitted into evidence avoiding such calamity for users is the entire point of having a no duplicates rule for the t2cr to begin with why remove to resubmit to remove because this is the only way to ensure you are following the submission rules of the t2cr while maintaining the existing nomenclature of the tokens given by the token developers if they had been given different nameslogostickers to reflect the fact that they are in fact different this wouldn't even be an issue isn't t2cr more useful without unlist days of active tokens useful for whom token creators who got themselves in a jam and now don't want to do the extra work required to make sure their tokens meet the submission standards it's certainly not more useful for the end users of the registry who would be at increased risk for being swindled due to duplicate and confusing token listings this statement of your shows an alarming and almost reckless disregard for the people who would ostensibly be buying your products unlisted tokens can always be relisted but customers who are scammed due to misleading information cannot get their money back isn't it more efficient to retain these until the new completely replaced the old reread your own submitted evidence and answer me this are they two completely different valid token assets or is one totally replacing the other and taking its place your side has played dumb and claimed both at the same time to try and worm around the fact that each position ultimately fails the requirements for inclusion into the t2cr in its own way you are trying to argue each angle in a vacuum hoping no one else notices but i do pick one position and stick with it because you can't have it both ways response to the post “bulleted arguments and rebuttal attached” you asked the question “lastly which line in the policy supports the token removal” i know you meant for this to be a rhetorical question but the actual correct answer to the question “which line in the policy supports the token removal” can be found in bulletpoint 6 the official t2cr policy document where it states “in the case of duplicates only the first submission should be accepted” the two token versions are identical in all relevant aspects other than contract address thus arguably making them duplicates – which would then necessitate removal under the policy line stated above the challenger also cites previous cases where tokens were rejected due to allegedly relatively minor incongruities in the visual format of token logos as a basis for not wanting to create bad precedents based entirely around arguing over increasingly granular technicalities aside from the ironic fact that the challenger is essentially employing the same sort of flawed reasoning he is deriding here to advocate for his own position these cases are irrelevant to the current issue at hand because those cases revolved around token logo compliance in accordance with the specified formatting rules in the t2cr policy in other words comparing the submission itself against the policy this case however is not focused on that – it is different and much more abstract cases 536 537 538 and 539 are about comparing a submission against another submission and then subsequently determining whether that comparison sufficiently violates the “no duplicates” policy in the t2cr guidelines i believe there is no argument to be made that it does not because the token submitter and those on the antiremoval side have already conceded that the name logo and ticker are duplicative of an earlier submission the version 1 token but that it really shouldn’t matter because if you examine closely enough one can see that the contract addresses are in fact different in summary the previous rulings in cases do not apply here since they were in essence about completely different issues furthermore the main argument of original submitter of the version 2 tokens as well as those in the antiremoval camp is just a thinly veiled attempt at sympathy rather than an argument that is based on anything substantive reading between the lines and paraphrasing i am seeing a lot of this on the part of the antiremoval side “we’re just following the rules as they’re written the proper and commonly used names happen to be the same” “the guidelines state no duplicates but we can’t help that our version 1 and version 2 tokens by admission two completely different tokens with unique addresses are identical in every other aspect yes it is potentially confusing and we admit that but if you made us follow the rules like everybody else our token wouldn’t be eligible it’s not fair to us we might even have to remove and resubmit our old tokens think of all the extra work might have to do to make sure consumers aren’t hoodwinked” spare me never mind the fact that their own conversations submitted by their own side as evidence contradict the notion that they have no idea why there would be now be controversy over the name and appearance of both token versions as they are currently labeled as stated earlier they are instead pretending to be oblivious andor innocently dumb about what the dispute is inherently about and choosing to blame the challengers and the authors of the t2cr guidelines for what is in reality the token submitter’s own failure to do their due diligence and properly differentiate their obviously different tokens in accordance with the t2cr policies policies i might add were published in the public domain well beforehand and thus any claim to ignorance on the matter defies credulity one could make the argument that the t2cr guidelines should be revised and clarified in the aftermath of this case so submitters have better idea of what constitutes a duplicate submission but to argue that the submitters of the token are being held to an retroactively arbitrary and unfair interpretation of the “no duplicates” policy is quite frankly a bit insulting to everyone else’s intelligence and taking such a claim at face value requires one to suspend disbelief and assume that marc zeller and his associates did not in fact believe what they were telling other people about the ongoing plans for both token versions at the time they were saying it these conversations have been submitted into evidence for cases 536 537 538 and 539 and can be viewed by everybody participating in the case i encourage everyone here to do so and see the contradictions for themselves it is not the fault of the t2cr policies nor is it the fault of those on the proremoval side that the developerssubmitters foolishly chose identical commonuse names tickers and logos for both token versions when 1 they knew they were not the same tokens as evidenced by the unique contract addresses 2 would be used concurrently and never at any point be the same until the version 1 was eventually phased out and 3 would in fact necessitate further differentiation in namelogoticker in due time which is largely what they proremoval side in all of these cases is using as a quite reasonable basis for arguing why the two tokensversions should appear differently in the registry to begin with phrased another way it is not necessarily a failure of the t2cr guidelines that in order to comply properly with the “no duplicates” policy as it is written the version 2 token would have had to have been submitted with the commonly used namelogoticker which also happens to be the commonly used namelogoticker of another and apparently entirely separate token that was previously submitted and accepted this is underlying basis for the sympathy angle the token submitters and antiremoval party is angling for as if to imply that the submitter’s hands were unfortunately tied in the matter but it doesn’t stand up to basic scrutiny while on its surface this may seem like an unfair catch22 situation for the token submitters in actuality it is not and such an argument on the part of the antiremoval party is in my opinion entirely disingenuous i will explain further the “no duplicates” policy has a clear intention and while perhaps not exhaustively specific it is nevertheless clear enough that anyone with common sense and basic reading comprehension can understand it and tailor their token submissions accordingly to comply if your tokens are by your own design and implementation going to be in violation of the stated t2cr policy from the very beginning then simply put that is your problem not the t2cr’s no one is forcing you to submit your tokens no one is changing the rulesstandards after the fact and no one is preventing your from asking pertinent questions of the kleros t2cr team and getting confirmation of the policy’s nuances before you spend the time and money submitting them for evaluation you may not like it it may have been an honest mistake or oversight you may think it is unfair you may even think it highlights an obvious ambiguity in the t2cr guidelines that needs to be addressed i for one agree that it does but the bottom line is this entire clown show could have been avoided if those behind the original token submission planned their own projects and implementation schedules better now instead of owning up to their error and redoing things properly they are hoping to convince enough people here to twist their own understanding of the definition of the word “duplicate” so that they may not only escape the negative consequences of their poor decisionmaking but actually profit from it – regardless of the obvious negative effects this could have on the quality of the t2cr registry and the consumers who rely on it for accurate information a sane and rational person would vote for removal of the token as a vote to allow the token would forever enshrine the right of token creators going forward to recklessly create and submit tokens with haphazard confusing and even borderline deceptive nomenclature while still being in compliance with the t2cr policies the result would mean more unnecessary risk and uncertainty being taken on by the end users who essentially will no longer be able to rely on the t2cr to vouch for the legitimacy of tokens or information regarding the tokens since users would be forced to consult multiple other sources to be reasonably sure of what they are seeingbuying a vote to allow the token to remain constitutes a clear lack of enforcement on this matter and would signal to the entire community the t2cr guidelines and submission standards are a joke and are not intended to be taken seriously anything other than a vote to remove the tokens in question would ultimately cripple the t2cr’s legitimacy and usefulness as a registry the risks to the people who use the registry in good faith far outweighs the immediate economic considerations of the token creatorssubmitters who are in this entirely avoidable situation largely due to their own poor choices and lack of forward thinking a vote to remove the token is only a temporary inconvenience to them and does not in any way prevent them from making the proper adjustments to their tokens and resubmitting them for future inclusion to the registry a vote for inclusion however forever hurts the peoplecommunity that uses the t2cr and who have an enormous stake in the outcome of this case despite bearing no responsibility for the sequence of events that led us here part 2 below is a copy of the justification a juror provided for his vote to remove the token in case 538 which definitely applies in this case as they are fundamentally identical situations i sincerely hope the kleros team is paying attention and sees this because i believe the crux of the matter being disputed in this case is largely derived from a glaring ambiguity in the official t2cr token curated list policies this is also an example of previous case law being unhelpful for providing a firm precedent or even basic guidance as similar cases have feature coherent rulings that are inherently contradictory the t2cr policies state that no 'duplicates' are to be accepted and yet it does not go on to explain in detail the following criteria which may be helpful in ascertaining whether a token submission qualifies does the term 'duplicate' in essence refer to a separate repeat instance of the same token being submitted obviously such an example would qualify under the term or does the definition of 'duplicate' also include different tokens that share 'duplicate' ie identical namestickerslogosetc under the former definition one could argue that the submission should not be removed as it is obviously a distinct token version with a unique contract address under the latter definition however it could easily be argued that due to sharing the same ticker name and logo that for the purposes of being listed in the database that it is a duplicate and that this violates the spirit of the no duplicates policy in the document outlining the t2cr rules there is also no clarification as to which set of criteria contract address vs naming conventionslogo is to take precedence in determining whether a submission is a duplicate in the event that a token meets one set of criteria but fails to meet another as is clearly the situation here frankly the fact that the original submitter behind both the aave v1 and v2 tokens opted to use the same naming conventions and logo between what were obviously two different tokens irks me because this whole dispute could have been avoided by simply not reusing the same nomenclature for both versions given that part of the submitted evidence on behalf of are statements from marc zeller indicating that 1 the two tokensversions are intended to be distinct from each other and 2 in the near future updated naming conventions for each version of the token clarifying this clear distinction are not only to be expected but actually are likely to be a necessity taking this statement at face value it would seem that the original submitter of the v1 and v2 aave enj token is obviously aware of the possible confusion that could be caused by having two separate tokens with different contract addresses share the same ticker logo and name but simply doesn't care because he is relying on a very narrow interpretation of the t2cr requirements to argue that because they are not actually duplicate tokens in practice every other piece of required information describing the two tokens may be duplicative between the two if this were the case then why bother having strict requirements for the names logos and tickers of submitted tokens to begin with per his own words the submitter is aware of the inherently duplicative nature of the aforementioned details and yet is pretending to play dumb and not understanding the obvious potential for confusion by focusing exclusively on the fact that at the moment the contract addresses and only the addresses mind you between the two tokens are different as sufficient proof they are not duplicates as far as the t2cr is concerned all while conveniently pretending as if the other variables simply don't exist or don't matter if a unique contract address was the only piece of identifying information required for determining whether a submission is a duplicate then surely the t2cr policies would have said so in more specificity would they not considering that no such language exists in the t2cr guidelines one should not assume that there is a reasonable basis for interpreting the requirements in such a manner by the same logic we can also infer that since token name ticker and logo are specifically referenced in the context of submission requirements and since past cases have used these factors to judge whether token submissions are duplicative we cannot simply disregard them now even if a particular novel reading of the established rules makes a plausible argument that they don't matter and never did matter as far as the true definition of duplicate is concerned furthermore however flawed or incomplete the t2cr's language may be when examined with stricter scrutiny the overall spirit of the law in having such submission requirements in the first place to prevent duplicates is to ultimately serve the end user's andor community's best interests by ensuring minimal confusion and accuracy of information regarding the tokens are that are ultimately allowed into the registry reinterpreting the guidelines in such a way that grants token submitters excessive leeway to submit different tokens with otherwise identical nomenclature and visual appearance especially when doing so could easily cause confusion and avoidable user errors arguably inverts the original objective of the t2cr policy so that it is primarily serving token creators first and consumersthe wider public a distant second the t2cr does not and should not operate primarily to benefit token submitters at the inevitable detriment of end users especially when the entire issue could have been mitigated by the token submitterdeveloper themselves if they had simply taken the time and effort to properly differentiate between their multiple tokens at the beforehand and given them unique indentifying qualities before trying to submit them to the registry the fact of the matter is that the token creators painted themselves into a corner by reusing the same name ticker and logo for both versions and rather than go back and properly differentiate them before proper resubmission they opted to submit what they had asis and try their luck anyway by claiming that the obviously duplicative aspects between tokens are not actually duplicative and thus not disqualifying because those aspects don't really matter anyway such reasoning on the part of the submitter and by extension the challenger arguing on their behalf 1 clearly runs contrary to the logic implied by the language in the t2cr submission rules as well as spirit of the rules themselves 2 requires a significant and unjustifiable reinterpretation of the submission rules as they are commonly understood 3 disregards prior case rulings that have upheld using the all aforementioned criteria for determining whether or not a submission is a duplicate for these reasons i am thus obligated to vote yes remove the token from the registry part 3 regarding previous voting roundsresults for case 539 for some reason i cannot attach documents to my posts so i am forced to copy the entirety of the text into the description box my apologies for the lengthiness as well as the lack of formatting but i strongly feel it is necessary for everyone to read this is my last evidence submission below for now earlier in the case the challengerantiremoval side claimed that case 539 due to being similar in terms of the issues at hand provided guidance for jurors to vote in this case because there was overwhelming consensus due to the eventual vote totals the following analysis will thoroughly dismantle this claim of theirs as little more than a red herring that is irrelevant to the strength of either side and not at all predicative of which side will prevail in later voting rounds more evidence for case 539 postappeal as stated earlier by multiple parties and observers case 539 is not only similar to cases 536 537 538 but they are all identical regarding the particular issue being debated there is no divergence and the same arguments proving the validity of the proremoval side equally apply for in all four cases it has been argued here and elsewhere that case 539 is different because there has been “consensus” reached by jurors in the previous rounds of voting that the challenge to the removal quest is the correct verdict but a quick analysis of the vote record easily disproves this and highlights why an appeal to the previous rulings in favor of the challenger is in fact the incorrect one simply put the “consensus” decisions by jurors in previous rounds is due almost entirely to lucky juror selection and vote weighing – perfectly valid under the rules of kleros but statistically anomalous and not indicative of a truly objective sample of independent jurors all of the following information can easily be viewed by anyone here in the klerosboard dispute scanner and i encourage everyone to check and see for yourselves for the sake of brevity i’m abbreviating the referenced juror id’s to the last several digitsletters for example in round 0 there were three juror ‘votes’ but only two different jurors ‘5e47’ and ‘f66c13’ due to court stake weighing f66c13 got to vote twice in the same round while 5e47 got one vote 5e47 voted “yes” to the removal request while f66c13 voted ‘no’ and since he got to vote ‘no’ twice 5e47 and the ‘yes’ side lost the round two votes to one in a normal jury this would result in a deadlock or more likely the tiebreaking third juror vote would belong to an independent third individual but this was not the case here it gets worse in the next round round 1 f66c13 got picked again while 5e47 did not once again f66c13 got to recast his “no” vote in an appeal round that was essentially contesting the fairness of the outcome of the previous round which was entirely decided by him and him alone now those claiming “consensus” will cite this round for proof arguing that all the other jurors voted unanimously with f66c13 and that fact should put the matter to rest as we will see it is not that simple likely figuring that the true margin between yesno votes when taking into account a larger sample size of the jury pool is probably much closer than the second round would indicate as proven by the first round the requester appeals again and opts for a larger 15vote jury pool in the next round but once again court stake weighting ends up burning him a third time in the next round round 2 as labeled in the kleros dispute scanner four of the seven jurors from the previous round are also picked again to recast the same vote on the same case f6613 now his third consecutive time voting 470a eeb2ca and d2364 furthermore whereas the previous round had all seven jurors one cast one ‘vote’ each in round 3 the randomized weighing skews the voting even worse f66c13 who had two votes in round 0 and had one vote in round 1 now has three votes in round 2 eeb2ca who did not vote in round 0 and had one vote in round 1 now has two votes in round 2 d2364 who did not vote in round 0 and had one vote in round 1 now has two votes in round 2 470a who did not vote in round 0 and had one vote in round 1 once again has one vote in round 2 predictably these four jurors cast the same vote ‘no’ as they did in the previous rounds assuming they are rational and would obviously never vote against themselves and lose staked pnk anyone can predict with a reasonable degree of certainty beforehand how they are going to vote so they are incentivized to vote the same way as before altogether these four jurors controlled eight of the fifteen jury votes allocated for round 2 by themselves these four jurors constituted the majority of the votes for the latest appeal round and thus much like in round 0 the outcome was a foregone conclusion arguably drawing other jurors for the latest appeal round wasn’t even necessary from a decision standpoint as the outcome was never in going to be in doubt even if every remaining first time voting on this case juror picked specifically for round 2 unanimously voted the opposite way it simply wouldn’t have mattered anyway because from the outset it was mathematically impossible for the requester to win given the same jurors were basically being asked to review their own verdict given the economic incentives in place for these jurors to uphold their previous ruling this represents an obvious conflict of interest in the kleros appeals process while no one is arguing that this unfortunate anomaly is against the rules or intentional it certainly is cosmically unfair and arguably defeats the original purpose of having an appeals process – which is to ensure that appellants can have a new set of jurors ie a fresh set of eyesearsperspectives reexamine the facts of the case and either overturn an unfair verdict or return the original verdict with a higher degree of confidence and consensus any juror in the current appeal round who might be lending credence to the fallacious argument that jurors should consider that all previous votes went in favor of the challenger should review this publiclyavailable information and consider for themselves the following 1 are the results of the previous voting rounds necessarily indicative of a proper jury ie one vote per unique juror would vote if they had the opportunity 2 given the obvious skews in voter weights and subsequent conflicts of interest are the results of the previous voting rounds indicative of how a new set of jurors hopefully more balanced would vote given the same presented evidencearguments 3 are you willing to risk your pnkstake betting that this pool of jurors that you currently sit in will be as biased and as poorly sampled as the previous three in a row all i am asking of jurors in this latest round is for them to simply base hisher vote on the facts of the case and arguments presented herein and only those factsarguments for those who may be nervous and tempted to vote to uphold previous rulings based on the false appearance of consensus it would be wise to disregard those results since they are indicative of absolutely nothing other than statistical noise – certainly not of the strength of the individual case arguments and certainly not how another jury is likely to vote afterward any claim to the contrary is a fallacious attempt on their part to bluffscare you into voting a certain way rather than articulating an actual defense of their position based on the facts of the case part 4 follow up rebuttal to challenger’s latest comment titled “here” posted 20 jan 2021 082210 gmt i will take the challenger's obvious deflection and passiveaggressive sarcasm as a sign he is conceding the overall argument all those words and yet you really had nothing else to say by all means feel free to refute my arguments if you can i'm happy to debate any of the points i raised i don't take such things personally since you bothered to post all that i will at least do you the courtesy of answering each statement of yours seriously even though i suspect that was hardly your intention first of all if you are going to forgo the use of logical discourse and instead rely on smarmy retorts to sway onlookers towards your side then at the very least make sure your comment isn’t composed primarily of runon sentences and borderline indecipherable syntax brevity is the soul of wit after all “above contention implies or more so demeans aave’s lack of vision to make a unique distinction to its token…” i did not imply it – i outright said it because it’s the truth and i will unapologetically say it again once more for the record aave got cocky andor sloppy didn’t do their due diligence and are now finding themselves “hoisted by their own petard” as the old saying goes “that discreetly leads users to its detriment…” an inevitable consequence for the t2cr userbase if the aaveantiremoval side has their way intentional or not this is what you are asking for either address the point and demonstrate how such an outcome is not detrimental or quit dismissing the concerns that have been raised “kleros t2cr team for not creating an allencompassing policy” i mentioned the kleros team because their policy as written is inherently susceptible to abuse by submitters like aave as there is an albeit frivolous opening for litigants to use the ambiguity in the current language to weasel their way around meeting the t2cr submission requirements rather than endlessly litigating situations like this i simply suggested the kleros team might find it useful to update and clarify the language in the t2cr guidelines so that there is a more defined set of criteria for everyone to use for assessing whether a submission is a duplicate a more clearly defined policy from the outset would have been to everyone’s benefit here would it not in any case what the kleros team decides to do with the t2cr going forward changes nothing as far as this case is concerned in other words you are still wrong “including but not limited to cultural interpretation language barrier and evolution imagination social injustice…” even in context the rest of your statement makes little to no sense but i will try my best with it anyway it sounds like you are not only misrepresenting what i said but also adding claims i never made in the first place hardly fair to me but then again you don’t even do a very good job of knocking down the strawman you created so it’s difficult for me to really get upset about it cultural interpretation are you from a different culture if you are claiming ignorance on these grounds well that sounds like that would have been a great thing to doublecheck before submitting otherwise this is irrelevant language barrier do you not speak english gee that sounds like it would have been a great thing to doublecheck before submitting imagination of all the non sequiturs you could have desperately pulled out of thin air this one might be the least helpful to bolstering your argument it doesn’t take much imagination to envision the original intent of the t2cr “no duplicates” rule and it takes even less imagination to see how different tokens with identical names logos and tickers would cause problems for unaware users social injustice if you are still failing to understand the ethical considerations of the position you are advocating for then there is not much else i can do i mean…i can explain it to you but i can’t understand it for you ”and its court results based purely on luck and anomalous statistical selection thereby treating no jurors without capabilities to think for themselves” i brought up the juror selection anomalies in case 539 because as i expected when your side ran out of actual arguments to employ you then tried to cite the voting results in case 539 as evidence that your side has already been judged by multiple rounds of jurors to be “right” and anyone looking for guidance on how others would vote could rely on that so as not to vote incoherently all i did was demonstrate that claim was utter bs i don’t see how you can accuse me of treating jurors like mindless sheep when i am the one that implored them to consider the facts – not the merely previous votes by fellow jurors and think for themselves your side however tried to induce them into voting a certain way by implying that they would be risking their staked pnk if they voted contrary to previous rounds arguably the only person here who is guilty of disregarding the individual agency of the jurors is you or whoever it was on your side that cited case 539 “you are a highborn of supreme intelligence” your words not mine not that i would ever describe myself in such a way all in all a rather petty way to round out your closing arguments if you ask me but i am not the manners police so feel free to express yourself “that can interpret policies beneath and beyond their plain meaning” this is more or less what your side the antiremoval side that is was hinging their entire strategy on across all four cases the proremoval side was demanding a narrower and less tortured reading of the rule in question more projection on your part “i

demonstrate how such an outcome is not detrimental or quit dismissing the concerns that have been raised “kleros t2cr team for not creating an allencompassing policy” i mentioned the kleros team because their policy as written is inherently susceptible to abuse by submitters like aave as there is an albeit frivolous opening for litigants to use the ambiguity in the current language to weasel their way around meeting the t2cr submission requirements rather than endlessly litigating situations like this i simply suggested the kleros team might find it useful to update and clarify the language in the t2cr guidelines so that there is a more defined set of criteria for everyone to use for assessing whether a submission is a duplicate a more clearly defined policy from the outset would have been to everyone’s benefit here would it not in any case what the kleros team decides to do with the t2cr going forward changes nothing as far as this case is concerned in other words you are still wrong “including but not limited to cultural interpretation language barrier and evolution imagination social injustice…” even in context the rest of your statement makes little to no sense

do a very good job of knocking down the strawman you created so it’s difficult for me to really get upset about it cultural interpretation are you from a different culture if you are claiming ignorance on these grounds well that sounds like that would have been a great thing to doublecheck before submitting otherwise this is irrelevant language barrier do you not speak english gee that sounds like it would have been a great thing to doublecheck before submitting imagination of all the non sequiturs you could have desperately pulled out of thin air this one might be the least helpful

identical names logos and tickers would cause problems for unaware users social injustice if you are still failing to understand the ethical considerations of the position you are advocating for then

‘votes’ but only two different jurors ‘5e47’ and ‘f66c13’ due to court stake weighing f66c13 got to vote twice in the same round while 5e47 got one vote 5e47 voted “yes” to the removal request while f66c13 voted ‘no’ and since he got to vote ‘no’ twice 5e47 and the ‘yes’ side lost the round two votes to one in a normal jury this would result in a deadlock or more likely the tiebreaking third juror vote would belong to an independent third individual but this was not the case here it gets worse in the next round round 1 f66c13 got picked again while 5e47 did not once again f66c13 got to recast his “no” vote in an appeal round that was essentially contesting the fairness of the outcome of the previous round which was entirely decided by him and him alone now those claiming “consensus” will cite this round for proof arguing that all the other jurors voted unanimously with f66c13 and that fact should put the matter to rest as we will see it is not that simple likely figuring that the true margin between yesno votes when taking into account a larger sample size of the jury pool is probably much closer than the second round would indicate as proven by the first round the requester appeals again and opts for a larger 15vote jury pool in the next round but once again court stake weighting ends up burning him a third time in the next round round 2 as labeled in the kleros dispute scanner four of the seven jurors from the previous round are also picked again to recast the same vote on the same case f6613 now his third consecutive time voting 470a eeb2ca and d2364 furthermore whereas the previous round had all seven jurors one cast one ‘vote’ each in round 3 the randomized weighing skews the voting even worse f66c13 who had two votes in round 0 and had one vote in round 1 now has three votes in round 2 eeb2ca who did not vote in round 0 and had one vote in round 1 now has two votes in round 2 d2364 who did not vote in round 0 and had one vote in round 1 now has two votes in round 2 470a who did not vote in round 0 and had one vote in round 1 once again has one vote in round 2 predictably these four jurors cast the same vote ‘no’ as they did in the previous rounds assuming they are rational and would obviously never vote against themselves and lose staked pnk anyone can predict with a reasonable degree of certainty beforehand how they are going to vote so they are incentivized to vote the same way as before altogether these four jurors controlled eight of the fifteen jury votes allocated for round 2 by themselves these four jurors constituted the majority of the votes for the latest appeal round and thus much like in round 0 the outcome was a foregone conclusion arguably drawing other jurors for the latest appeal round wasn’t even necessary from a decision standpoint as the outcome was never in going to be in doubt even if every remaining first time voting on this case juror picked specifically for round 2 unanimously voted the opposite way it simply wouldn’t have mattered anyway because from the outset it was mathematically impossible for the requester to win given the same jurors were basically being asked to review their own verdict given the economic incentives in place for these jurors to uphold their previous ruling this represents an obvious conflict of interest in the kleros appeals process while no one is arguing that this unfortunate anomaly is against the rules or intentional it certainly is cosmically unfair and arguably defeats the original purpose of having an appeals process – which is to ensure that appellants can have a new set of jurors ie a fresh set of eyesearsperspectives reexamine the facts of the case and either overturn an unfair verdict or return the original verdict with a higher degree of confidence and consensus any juror in the current appeal round who might be lending credence to the fallacious argument that jurors should consider that all previous votes went in favor of the challenger should review this publiclyavailable information and consider for themselves the following 1 are the results of the previous voting rounds necessarily indicative of a proper jury ie one vote per unique juror would vote if they had the opportunity 2 given the obvious skews in voter weights and subsequent conflicts of interest are the results of the previous voting rounds indicative of how a new set of jurors hopefully more balanced would vote given the same presented evidencearguments 3 are you willing to risk your pnkstake betting that this pool of jurors that you currently sit in will be as biased and as poorly sampled as the previous three in a row all i am asking of jurors in this latest round is for them to simply base hisher vote on the facts of the case and arguments presented herein and only those factsarguments for those who may be nervous and tempted to vote to uphold previous rulings based on the false appearance of consensus it would be wise to disregard those results since they are indicative of absolutely nothing other than statistical noise – certainly not of the strength of the individual case arguments and certainly not how another jury is likely to vote afterward any claim to the contrary is a fallacious attempt on their part to bluffscare you into voting a certain way rather than articulating an actual defense of their position based on the facts of the case'}, '6': {'title': 'long overdue response to challenger post 2 of', 'description': ""below is a copy of the justification a juror provided for his vote to remove the token in case 538 which definitely applies in this case as they are fundamentally identical situations i sincerely hope the kleros team is paying attention and sees this because i believe the crux of the matter being disputed in this case is largely derived from a glaring ambiguity in the official t2cr token curated list policies this is also an example of previous case law being unhelpful for providing a firm precedent or even basic guidance as similar cases have feature coherent rulings that are inherently contradictory the t2cr policies state that no 'duplicates' are to be accepted and yet it does not go on to explain in detail the following criteria which may be helpful in ascertaining whether a token submission qualifies does the term 'duplicate' in essence refer to a separate repeat instance of the same token being submitted obviously such an example would qualify under the term or does the definition of 'duplicate' also include different tokens that share 'duplicate' ie identical namestickerslogosetc under the former definition one could argue that the submission should not be removed as it is obviously a distinct token version with a unique contract address under the latter definition however it could easily be argued that due to sharing the same ticker name and logo that for the purposes of being listed in the database that it is a duplicate and that this violates the spirit of the no duplicates policy in the document outlining the t2cr rules there is also no clarification as to which set of criteria contract address vs naming conventionslogo is to take precedence in determining whether a submission is a duplicate in the event that a token meets one set of criteria but fails to meet another as is clearly the situation here frankly the fact that the original submitter behind both the aave v1 and v2 tokens opted to use the same naming conventions and logo between what were obviously two different tokens irks me because this whole dispute could have been avoided by simply not reusing the same nomenclature for both versions given that part of the submitted evidence on behalf of are statements from marc zeller indicating that 1 the two tokensversions are intended to be distinct from each other and 2 in the near future updated naming conventions for each version of the token clarifying this clear distinction are not only to be expected but actually are likely to be a necessity taking this statement at face value it would seem that the original submitter of the v1 and v2 aave enj token is obviously aware of the possible confusion that could be caused by having two separate tokens with different contract addresses share the same ticker logo and name but simply doesn't care because he is relying on a very narrow interpretation of the t2cr requirements to argue that because they are not actually duplicate tokens in practice every other piece of required information describing the two tokens may be duplicative between the two if this were the case then why bother having strict requirements for the names logos and tickers of submitted tokens to begin with per his own words the submitter is aware of the inherently duplicative nature of the aforementioned details and yet is pretending to play dumb and not understanding the obvious potential for confusion by focusing exclusively on the fact that at the moment the contract addresses and only the addresses mind you between the two tokens are different as sufficient proof they are not duplicates as far as the t2cr is concerned all while conveniently pretending as if the other variables simply don't exist or don't matter if a unique contract address was the only piece of identifying information required for determining whether a submission is a duplicate then surely the t2cr policies would have said so in more specificity would they not considering that no such language exists in the t2cr guidelines one should not assume that there is a reasonable basis for interpreting the requirements in such a manner by the same logic we can also infer that since token name ticker and logo are specifically referenced in the context of submission requirements and since past cases have used these factors to judge whether token submissions are duplicative we cannot simply disregard them now even if a particular novel reading of the established rules makes a plausible argument that they don't matter and never did matter as far as the true definition of duplicate is concerned furthermore however flawed or incomplete the t2cr's language may be when examined with stricter scrutiny the overall spirit of the law in having such submission requirements in the first place to prevent duplicates is to ultimately serve the end user's andor community's best interests by ensuring minimal confusion and accuracy of information regarding the tokens are that are ultimately allowed into the registry reinterpreting the guidelines in such a way that grants token submitters excessive leeway to submit different tokens with otherwise identical nomenclature and visual appearance especially when doing so could easily cause confusion and avoidable user errors arguably inverts the original objective of the t2cr policy so that it is primarily serving token creators first and consumersthe wider public a distant second the t2cr does not and should not operate primarily to benefit token submitters at the inevitable detriment of end users especially when the entire issue could have been mitigated by the token submitterdeveloper themselves if they had simply taken the time and effort to properly differentiate between their multiple tokens at the beforehand and given them unique indentifying qualities before trying to submit them to the registry the fact of the matter is that the token creators painted themselves into a corner by reusing the same name ticker and logo for both versions and rather than go back and properly differentiate them before proper resubmission they opted to submit what they had asis and try their luck anyway by claiming that the obviously duplicative aspects between tokens are not actually duplicative and thus not disqualifying because those aspects don't really matter anyway such reasoning on the part of the submitter and by extension the challenger arguing on their behalf 1 clearly runs contrary to the logic implied by the language in the t2cr submission rules as well as spirit of the rules themselves 2 requires a significant and unjustifiable reinterpretation of the submission rules as they are commonly understood 3 disregards prior case rulings that have upheld using the all aforementioned criteria for determining whether or not a submission is a duplicate for these reasons i am thus obligated to

challenger’s most recent comments i have been following all four aave token cases 536 537 538 and 539 as well as your challenges to the token removal requests from the very beginning you can wave your money around and arrogantly demean and threaten people all you want but that does not make your claims any more legitimate or believable plenty of jurors and third parties across all four cases have articulated why your position is fundamentally flawed and borderline dishonest and provided much more comprehensive counterarguments than you have to demonstrate support for their side rather than address those counterarguments point by point and refute them because you can’t you casually and hubristically ignore them altogether and instead copypaste the same comments over and over again hoping that enough people here are not engaged enough to notice what you are trying to pull the “evidences” that you have submitted on your own behalf not only do not sufficiently prove what you are ultimately trying to claim but upon close examination actually undermine the very claims you are trying to make anybody who takes the time and effort to carefully crossreference and examine all the submitted evidence will see that your entire position relies on poor reasoning selfishness and a deliberate disregard for common sense i will post more refutations to previous comments soon but in the meantime i encourage all jurors to read the lengthy justification statements previous jurors on the proremoval side have provided for their votes in cases 537 538 and 539 there have been attempts to enter those arguments into the evidence record for prior to voting for everyone to consider but thus far such efforts have been stymied by the limitations of the kleros court system interface in any case i have copied these arguments which quite thoroughly destroy the comparatively shallow points made the antiremoval side and attached them to this comment so that if others are unable to view them in courtklerosio they can download the file and read them for themselves line by line response to the post “argument against removal no” first a uniswap user uses the contract address to search for the token to swap arguably false as anyone who opens up the uniswap app can see that the search menu states search name or paste address considering that the name and not the specific contract address is first and foremost what people will likely use when searching for the token as it is shorter easier to remember and more publicly known hence the reason for having names for contract addresses in the first place two different addresses with the same nameticker is both duplicative and confusing the presumption that uniswap users automatically know what to do is a silly and unjustifiable stretch of the imagination how would an aave user automatically know which contract address is the one they are supposedly looking for where do they find this information if not in the registries and apps like t2cr where these tokens are listed this is akin to expecting users who are not as intimately familiar with these projects as the developers are to be able to either read minds or do burdensome levels of research and verification before utilizing token registries which of course negates the point of having curated registries in the first place evidently previous token will be replaced as soon as presented this statement is directly contradicted by the screenshot of the statements of bigmike and pablo candela already submitted into evidence which indicates both tokens will be active alongside each other for an indeterminate amount of time thus one is not merely replacing the other outright there will be two tokens listed for people to see how would having them appear in the lists with identical namestickerslogos not duplicative and therefore potentially confusing for people who don't know which one is which and given the fact that it shares the same name with the newer version as i will explain in further detail below this is a completely irrelevant consideration what's the point of resubmitting it with 'v1' or 'old' and adding v2 for new oneswhen v1 will fade away soon as proven earlier according to the team behind the tokens v1 will not be fading away soon the point of resubmitting with different names is to avoid duplicate token listings so that users are not tricked into accidentally buying incorrect or illiquid assets a possible scenario which is acknowledged by the screenshot of the text conversation between marc zeller and santiago koki already submitted into evidence avoiding such calamity for users is the entire point of having a no duplicates rule for the t2cr to begin with why remove to resubmit to remove because this is the only way to ensure you are following the submission rules of the t2cr while maintaining the existing nomenclature of the tokens given by the token developers if they had been given different nameslogostickers to reflect the fact that they are in fact different this wouldn't even be an issue isn't t2cr more useful without unlist days of active tokens useful for whom token creators who got themselves in a jam and now don't want to do the extra work required to make sure their tokens meet the submission standards it's certainly not more useful for the end users of the registry who would be at increased risk for being swindled due to duplicate and confusing token listings this statement of your shows an alarming and almost reckless disregard for the people who would ostensibly be buying your products unlisted tokens can always be relisted but customers who are scammed due to misleading information cannot get their money back isn't it more efficient to retain these until the new completely replaced the old reread your own submitted evidence and answer me this are they two completely different valid token assets or is one totally replacing the other and taking its place your side has played dumb and claimed both at the same time to try and worm around the fact that each position ultimately fails the requirements for inclusion into the t2cr in its own way you are trying to argue each angle in a vacuum hoping no one else notices but i do pick one position and stick with it because you can't have it both ways response to the post “bulleted arguments and rebuttal attached” you asked the question “lastly which line in the policy supports the token removal” i know you meant for this to be a rhetorical question but the actual correct answer to the question “which line in the policy supports the token removal” can be found in bulletpoint 6 the official t2cr policy document where it states “in the case of duplicates only the first submission should be accepted” the two token versions are identical in all relevant aspects other than contract address thus arguably making them duplicates – which would then necessitate removal under the policy line stated above the challenger also cites previous cases where tokens were rejected due to allegedly relatively minor incongruities in the visual format of token logos as a basis for not wanting to create bad precedents based entirely around arguing over increasingly granular technicalities aside from the ironic fact that the challenger is essentially employing the same sort of flawed reasoning he is deriding here to advocate for his own position these cases are irrelevant to the current issue at hand because those cases revolved around token logo compliance in accordance with the specified formatting rules in the t2cr policy in other words comparing the submission itself against the policy this case however is not focused on that – it is different and much more abstract cases 536 537 538 and 539 are about comparing a submission against another submission and then subsequently determining whether that comparison sufficiently violates the “no duplicates” policy in the t2cr guidelines i believe there is no argument to be made that it does not because the token submitter and those on the antiremoval side have already conceded that the name logo and ticker are duplicative of an earlier submission the version 1 token but that it really shouldn’t matter because if you examine closely enough one can see that the contract addresses are in fact different in summary the previous rulings in cases do not apply here since they were in essence about completely different issues furthermore the main argument of original submitter of the version 2 tokens as well as those in the antiremoval camp is just a thinly veiled attempt at sympathy rather than an argument that is based on anything substantive reading between the lines and paraphrasing i am seeing a lot of this on the part of the antiremoval side “we’re just following the rules as they’re written the proper and commonly used names happen to be the same” “the guidelines state no duplicates but we can’t help that our version 1 and version 2 tokens by admission two completely different tokens with unique addresses are identical in every other aspect yes it is potentially confusing and we admit that but if you made us follow the rules like everybody else our token wouldn’t be eligible it’s not fair to us we might even have to remove and resubmit our old tokens think of all the extra work might have to do to make sure consumers aren’t hoodwinked” spare me never mind the fact that their own conversations submitted by their own side as evidence contradict the notion that they have no idea why there would be now be controversy over the name and appearance of both token versions as they are currently labeled as stated earlier they are instead pretending to be oblivious andor innocently dumb about what the dispute is inherently about and choosing to blame the challengers and the authors of the t2cr guidelines for what is in reality the token submitter’s own failure to do their due diligence and properly differentiate their obviously different tokens in accordance with the t2cr policies policies i might add were published in the public domain well beforehand and thus any claim to ignorance on the matter defies credulity one could make the argument that the t2cr guidelines should be revised and clarified in the aftermath of this case so submitters have better idea of what constitutes a duplicate submission but to argue that the submitters of the token are being held to an retroactively arbitrary and unfair interpretation of the “no duplicates” policy is quite frankly a bit insulting to everyone else’s intelligence and taking such a claim at face value requires one to suspend disbelief and assume that marc zeller and his associates did not in fact believe what they were telling other people about the ongoing plans for both token versions at the time they were saying it these conversations have been submitted into evidence for cases 536 537 538 and 539 and can be viewed by everybody participating in the case i encourage everyone here to do so and see the contradictions for themselves it is not the fault of the t2cr policies nor is it the fault of those on the proremoval side that the developerssubmitters foolishly chose identical commonuse names tickers and logos for both token versions when 1 they knew they were not the same tokens as evidenced by the unique contract addresses 2 would be used concurrently and never at any point be the same until the version 1 was eventually phased out and 3 would in fact necessitate further differentiation in namelogoticker in due time which is largely what they proremoval side in all of these cases is using as a quite reasonable basis for arguing why the two tokensversions should appear differently in the registry to begin with phrased another way it is not necessarily a failure of the t2cr guidelines that in order to comply properly with the “no duplicates” policy as it is written the version 2 token would have had to have been submitted with the commonly used namelogoticker which also happens to be the commonly used namelogoticker of another and apparently entirely separate token that was previously submitted and accepted this is underlying basis for the sympathy angle the token submitters and antiremoval party is angling for as if to imply that the submitter’s hands were unfortunately tied in the matter but it doesn’t stand up to basic scrutiny while on its surface this may seem like an unfair catch22 situation for the token submitters in actuality it is not and such an argument on the part of the antiremoval party is in my opinion entirely disingenuous i will explain further the “no duplicates” policy has a clear intention and while perhaps not exhaustively specific it is nevertheless clear enough that anyone with common sense and basic reading comprehension can understand it and tailor their token submissions accordingly to comply if your tokens are by your own design and implementation going to be in violation of the stated t2cr policy from the very beginning then simply put that is your problem not the t2cr’s no one is forcing you to submit your tokens no one is changing the rulesstandards after the fact and no one is preventing your from asking pertinent questions of the kleros t2cr team and getting confirmation of the policy’s nuances before you spend the time and money submitting them for evaluation you may not like it it may have been an honest mistake or oversight you may think it is unfair you may even think it highlights an obvious ambiguity in the t2cr guidelines that needs to be addressed i for one agree that it does but the bottom line is this entire clown show could have been avoided if those behind the original token submission planned their own projects and implementation schedules better now instead of owning up to their error and redoing things properly they are hoping to convince enough people here to twist their own understanding of the definition of the word “duplicate” so that they may not only escape the negative consequences of their poor decisionmaking but actually profit from it – regardless of the obvious negative effects this could have on the quality of the t2cr registry and the consumers who rely on it for accurate information a sane and rational person would vote for removal of the token as a vote to allow the token would forever enshrine the right of token creators going forward to recklessly create and submit tokens with haphazard confusing and even borderline deceptive nomenclature while still being in compliance with the t2cr policies the result would mean more unnecessary risk and uncertainty being taken on by the end users who essentially will no longer be able to rely on the t2cr to vouch for the legitimacy of tokens or information regarding the tokens since users would be forced to consult multiple other sources to be reasonably sure of what they are seeingbuying a vote to allow the token to remain constitutes a clear lack of enforcement on this matter and would signal to the entire community the t2cr guidelines and submission standards are a joke and are not intended to be taken seriously anything other than a vote to remove the tokens in question would ultimately cripple the t2cr’s legitimacy and usefulness as a registry the risks to the people who use the registry in good faith far outweighs the immediate economic considerations of the token creatorssubmitters who are in this entirely avoidable situation largely due to their own poor choices and lack of forward thinking a vote to remove the token is only a temporary inconvenience to them and does not in any way prevent them from making the proper adjustments to their tokens and resubmitting them for future inclusion to the registry a vote for inclusion however forever hurts the peoplecommunity that uses the t2cr and who have an enormous stake in the outcome of this case despite bearing no responsibility

before removing the old one the challenger would have challenged me too but then for submitting a duplicate he is just trying to find something to challenge me on although i would understand if he would have challenged for duplicates because we shouldn't want to have duplicates same name ticker and logo in the t2cr as that would only cause confusion among users of the kleros tokenlist there needs to be a distinction between the old v1 depreciating tokens and the new staying v2 tokens as the v2 tokens will remain they need to use the correct names so aave yfi in this case the challenger is lying about the reason for the rejections of marc's submissions which was not as the challenger is trying to pursway only because of the logo quality all his submissions were also challenged for being duplicates you can see that in the cases yourself lets keep the t2cr a usefull list of curated tokens which users can use to trade on uniswap and for more we can't allow duplicates in this list which is also against the policy of course just like all the other aave v1 tokens which were already removed these last 4 need to be removed as well in order to be able to add the v2 tokens to the t2cr lets not make this too much of a hassle as it's certainly necessary to remove these last 4 tokens ps coingecko and coinmarketcap are simply not up to date as they still have the old tokens listed only they are no valid source in this case as they are outdated as can be seen with other projects they usually list the new tokens and use old behind the names of the old tokens in the case of aave i

really matter and changed telegram group name to growth defi if the community are uncertain themselves about the capitalization of the token and tend to use the natural growth casing that differs from the official does that mean such tokens will not be allowed to enter tcr a similar case could be made if this was submitted as growth defi then as users mostly use growth or gro when referring to it

you are referring to that submission dates back to the 4th of july 2019 which was 460 days ago and a lot has changed in kleros since if you read well you saw that the challenger back then wrote according to current court policy and jurisprudence this submission should be without the term token as i explained before the guidelines and precedents were different back then the policy still included the word 'project name' which caused a precedent of only accepting submissions using their project names after changing the policy to 'use the most commonly used name to refer to the asset' jurisprudence changed too you can see that there are nowadays more than 30 submissions with a 'token' or 'coin' suffix in the name they all get accepted because current policy and jurisprudence now demands to use the most commonly used name in this case the most commonly used name is atomic wallet coin you can't deny that the requester is falsely claiming that i posted evidence that 'sometimes' atomic wallet token and 'sometimes' atomic wallet coin is used to refer to this asset that's not true at all what i wrote is most of the time the coin suffix is used and sometimes the token suffix atomic wallet coin awc is by far the most commonly used name and should thus be used for the t2cr second debatable option would be to use atomic wallet token as it's still used by some sources however just atomic wallet is never used to refer to this asset and is thus unfit to use as the name for the t2cr unfortunately i have to keep repeating myself but the policy reads as following ➤ suffixes

it was not enactedexecuted yet it has no power in court yet for reference background the tcr is a generic list and the kleros team nor the community have any power over how other peopledapps will integrate it they might use it on a light background they might use it on a dark background it's up to them to decide so the argument about the keep brand guide which states that the logo shouldn't be

invalidates your own submission because then you would still have provided the wrong logo imagine that you submitted the correct logo to the tcr so with the mint background then that logo would look exactly the same as on the keep network official media channels if viewed in a rounded cropped display namely a black round circle with a thick green edge i want to urge the jury to follow

you risk losing your deposit this is just how kleros works this mechanism makes sure that people are incentivized to make correct submissions while also incentivizing the kleros community to double check submissions made to the tcr for mistakes or scam attempts for instance through fake contract addresses we cannot allow to step away from jurisprudence because someone did not know about this yes it can feel unfair to lose your deposit because you didn't know you had to provide the most commonly used logo but you knew the risks and rewards of submitting beforehand the sole reason that you are submitting tokens to the tcr is because you want to farm pnk so saying that it feels wrong to deny this submission is nonsense you knew about the risks of submitting tokens to the tcr and you still

justifications had the core of the symbol in white or light color needing a background with contrast etc no doubt there is an implied rule the logo must be the actual token symbol that is the common sense and the logo should be included in full which get applied in those cases as there is no clearly expressed rule that the token must be the most commonly used concluding this is all what many cases were about could be wrong or any case that would have ruled on this justification alone could be wrong jurisprudence is to be prudent but there is no court policy that a precedent case must be

scare new users away because of subtilities 2 it doesn't matter that coin trackers took the same logo as in telegram and twitter which have a logo about the project and not specifically the transparent token actually the resulting displays after telegram and twitter rounded the logo show that keep wants a small green edge to show for example refusing this submission would fail to accept the actual transparent token symbol and all official features present in the symbol being in the media kit the last two arguments about quality are wrong because they ask for excellence and for perfect quality while the policy asks for a quality high enough clement also speaks to keep the list high quality not perfect quality in that screenshot the other rejections like powerpool had worst

True,"Introduction
Claimant seeks compensation for a discrepancy in PNK rewards (71935.48 PNK) he suffered by the Kleros Cooperative’s incorrect moving away of his two January 2020 storytelling submissions to the second timeframe. Respondent had been notified of the issue less than six hours after its sharing of the reward spreadsheet; yet, it has failed to correct the mistake either at the time or after the fact. After months of discussions and leaving the matter pending, the parties cease such efforts and cause a case to be brought to the Kleros Court.

The full information on the previous centralized storytelling program can be found on the Kleros blog, with a 25/02/2020 archive on the Wayback Machine (the ""Program Terms""). The Program Terms provided: ""In case a participant disagrees with his share of the reward, Kleros Escrow will be used to settle the dispute."" A summary version of the Program Terms can be found in a previously used primary document for disputes on rewards.
The parties have agreed to change the resolution mechanism from the Escrow to the Dispute Resolver for such issues and the Marketing Subcourt was previously stipulated for a related case (no. 167). (See Stipulation [transcript of Telegram chat].) The Kleros Coop did not object to using this specific subcourt for this case. (See July Slack chat [emphasis added].)
Therefore, the Claimant submits this Marketing Subcourt has the jurisdiction to resolve this off-chain dispute created through the Dispute Resolver.
Facts
The Claimant incorporates herein the facts present in the list of exhibits, primarily found in the email thread, and directs the jury’s attention to its highlighted contents.
In short: The publication and submission of the two items were both made on the last day available; the first period was between “10/12/2019 and 10/01/2020”, and 12/01/2020 is “at least a week before the distribution date” (originally planned as 20/01/2020). Therefore, those items should have been included within the first timeframe rather than the second. The first timeframe had very few submissions, making rewards higher. With these items' proper inclusion, their 8 points together should have been out of 50 total points, amounting for 16% of 500000 PNK (that is, 80000 PNK). Because of their improper moving away to the second timeframe and non-resolution of claimant's issue when timely raised, 8064.52 PNK were received instead. (See public spreadsheet at items 33 and 40.)
Timeline
All times in this brief are in Claimant’s local time, that is GMT-4 / ET, except as otherwise noted.
On January 12, 2020, shortly before 5:25 PM (the screenshot time), Claimant made a submission of two items via the Google form for the program. (See screenshots of submission, filled out and confirmed.) The Kleros Coop’s spreadsheet shows a timestamp of ""12/01/2020 22:24:13"" (Kleros Coop's time). (See screenshot of timestamp on spreadsheet shared by Stuart.) This was “at least a week before the distribution date” (originally planned as 20/01/2020). (See Program Terms.)
On February 4, 2020, Damjan of the Kleros Coop posted in the Telegram group: “we changed our dynamic a bit” and asked to “drop all of your submissions directly to myself.”
On February 6, 2020, assuming the previous submission must be made again and out of caution, Claimant dropped his “first submission” (of items dated January 10th, the last publication day for the first timeframe) via Telegram and had Damjan acknowledge receipt thereof. (See screenshot of first Telegram submission.)
On February 25, 2020, at 10:49 AM, Damjan announced the release of a spreadsheet of tentative rewards.
Less than six hours later, at 4:26 PM, Claimant notified Damjan of the issue in question via Telegram. (See screenshot of notification of issue to Damjan and response.)
On February 27, 2020, at 09:20 AM, Damjan responded to get in touch with Stuart. (See ibid.) Notably, Damjan agreed on behalf of the Kleros Coop “we’re covering the initial dispute fees” in the event of a dispute. (See ibid.)
On February 27, 2020, at 6:19 PM, Claimant emailed Stuart. Absent a response, Claimant followed up on March 6, 2020. (See email thread.)
Over those days and months, the Kleros Coop did not cause a dispute to be created before or after the final distribution, or otherwise resolve the issue, despite claimant’s notice within hours from the first spreadsheet release. However, Stuart raised the possibility to maybe ""send over some more PNK."" (See ibid. at p. 2.) Claimant indicated he would be awaiting such a possible offer. (See ibid. at p. 1.)
On July 27, 2020, the Kleros Coop finally closed the issue as an internal support matter, by deciding “we won’t make you an offer, nor pay for the initial fees for a case.” (See July Slack chat [emphasis added].) This is contrary to Stuart and Damjan’s previous assertions, respectively.
These previous communications were using an earlier figure of 3921.57 PNK that would be rewarded per item, found on a previous speadsheet. The final spreadsheet rewarded 4032.26 PNK in the end. Claimant has been arguing it should have been 40000 PNK for each of the two items.
The issue now comes as a Kleros Court matter.
Related Case
In Kleros Court Case No. 166, the Court resolved a similar issue in Claimant’s favor. The Kleros Coop had rejected an item published on February 11 and submitted on February 12, with the reason as out of timeframe. The publication and submission were both made on the last day available; the second period was between “11/01/2019sic and 11/02/2020”, and 12/02/2020 was “at least a week before the distribution date” (originally planned as 20/02/2020). Had the Kleros Coop forgotten the submission timeframe was a bit longer than the publication deadline?
Because that issue B and the issue A here are the same on acceptance of the time of submission in keeping with the Program Terms (these letters A and B were used to identify the issues in the email thread), Claimant should similarly be awarded the rewards to which he was entitled here.
Claim
Moving the said two items to the correct timeframe would have meant being rewarded 8% each (40000 PNK each) rather than 0.78% each (4032.26 PNK each). The discrepancy is (40000 x 2) - (4032.26 x 2) = 80000 - 8064.52 = 71935.48 PNK, which Claimant requests for enforcement of the Program Terms and compensation.
Per the Kleros Coop’s February 27, 2020 agreement through its representative Damjan to be “covering the initial dispute fees” in the event of a dispute, the Claimant is entitled to recover the 0.30 ETH paid to create this dispute. (See screenshot of notification of issue to Damjan and response.)
Claimant therefore respectfully requests 71935.48 PNK in compensatory damages and 0.30 ETH in initial arbitration costs.

False,"Will there be a day with at least 1000 reported Corona death in the US in the first 14 days of July?
According to https://www.statnews.com/feature/coronavirus/covid-19-tracker there were two days with at least 1000 Coronavirus deaths during the first 14 days of July. This can be verified by changing the selection on the left to ""United States"" from ""Worldwide"" and changing the ""2 Week"" reporting to ""1 Day"". Both July 7th and July 9th had at least 1000 deaths for the United States, which satisfies the market requirement.
Party A claims that StatNews should not be considered a valid source for Coronavirus reporting and that the market should resolve to NO.
Party B claims that StatNews should be considered a valid source for Coronavirus reporting and that the market should resolve to YES.
The market in question does not specify a source, and it is safe to believe that StatNews is fairly reputable as they are both verified on Twitter and were mentioned by the New York Times for their early coronavirus coverage.

There is also a Force Majeure (Act of God) clause that releases the Vendor from milestone deadlines with no penalty if the agreed upon performance is impacted by an ""Act of God"" (an instance of uncontrollable natural forces in operation).
Vendor is unable to meet Purchaser's deadlines because the COVID19 pandemic shut down Vendor's work.

But he thinks that small problems can be immediately fixed as soon as he notices it. Compared to having a car loan that needs monthly amortization and takes years to finish.
So he dropped by to a car shop selling old cars and saw it selling an old SUV for $5000. Upon checking the unit, the interiors are still in good condition as well as the exterior. The seats, covers, mirrors, and the paint looks brand new. It also has a good speaker for audio and new tires. Tom paid for the car and the shop gave him the documents notarized.

False,"Shane is a freelance writer and is observing the situation since the beginning of the outbreak. Looking back at the time when everyone has freedom. Doing a lot of things, struggling with traffic jams to hit deadlines, and quality time is seasonal. With the sudden surge of virus scarcity, everything has turned upside down.
According to an economist, the ""new normal"" is happening right now. Situations could go worse as time goes by. The market cannot recover easily as the operations of companies cannot go back to normal. As superstitions in the early days say that in the future, the world will fall deep and a new world will rise. It is clear that coronavirus has resulted in a bad economic impact. As the nations are battling with Covid-19, livelihoods and businesses are much affected. Shares in stocks are being sold hoping to save the losses before it goes worse. Commodities and markets crashed. Travel restrictions and lockdowns are everywhere. Everything is happening for the first time in history.
But based on Shane's research, studies show that emerging technologies can resolve the issues of operations today. For instance, the internet is a great tool for communication and engagement. There are other useful technologies as well, such as AI and Blockchain. These technologies are very useful in developing solutions for any application.
However, with the current situation of staying at home for most individuals, as schools as well were being suspended, Shane thinks that there is a high rate of effectivity in using these technologies. And mass adoption can be gained if the people or community is supported by their needs. Resources is limited and not everyone has access to the internet.

False,"As the pandemic continues, it is getting harder for the community to move like the normal days as the lockdown limits access to places and in going outdoors. Nowadays, E-commerce platforms are rising because of the significant growth in the business. Buying almost everything you need seems to be available online and that it also boosts the market for the logistics industry.
A reliable shopping company in a city offers its online store to serve the community with easy access to groceries and pharmacies by using their platform.
The platform would need the following information to place the orders:
Customer’s Full Name
Complete Address
Eth Address
Total Items
Amount Due
The Challenge
But, there's a ""trust issue"" with half of the community who are not used to online shopping. As they fear using the platform in sharing private information to shop online.
The Solution
In able to solve this problem, the shopping company would only ask the customers to pay half of the total amount and pay the remaining upon receiving the delivery. So the company looked for a partnership with a reliable delivery company. They made an agreement to collect the customer’s remaining payment on behalf of the latter. They added another payment option which is COD or “Cash On Delivery” for half of the remaining payment.
To take effect, on behalf of the customer the logistics company pays the store owner in advance with 3% off as part of the agreement. And then notifies the customers to prepare the payment ahead of time before the delivery schedule. They can then take the amount collected in every shipment with an extra charge for the delivery fee.

""Bad food, horrible service, there's a rat in the kitchen. Don't eat there.""
Jane replied to Dave, asking him to message her directly to discuss his complaint so she can do something about it.
She also requested Dave to delete his negative comment, but Dave's reply got the situation even worse.
"" Oops, No offense meant. Just my honest opinion.""
In less than 40 minutes, that post went viral.
Jane has suffered distress and anxiety because of defamatory content and false statements made by Dave.
According to Jane, social media companies have the capability to censor content, but they won't be able to control how ideas spread offline. Falsehoods and hateful ideas will not spread if people are presented with counter arguments. Jane fights back, demanding the social media platform admin to deactivate Dave's account plus compensation for moral damages.

The vacation rental homeowner, Dave, required a $200.00 security deposit, but it would be refunded if they left the house in good shape. So before the family checked out, Jane made sure to walk through the house to confirm there was no damage.
When Jane inquired about the return of their security deposit 15 days after they checked out, they were told that they damaged the house and the vacation rental homeowner would be keeping the security deposit. Jane got upset when she heard about the homeowner’s decision.
Jane wanted a full refund of the security deposit so she pointed out a few things to justify her claim:
The faucet handle was already broken when they arrived.
The scratches in the side table were already there when they arrived. They did not damage it.
The wear-and-tear items are very cheap and easy to replace.
The security deposit is too much.

standard of evidence applies for criterion 115 by citing it i could avoid to spell everything out again but even citing an opinion by another juror could not be considered bias as it shows that the legal opinion backed by the precedent is shared by other jurors as well this increases its legitimacy in a way and makes the application of ambiguous clauses more foreseeable to both parties 4 i see no reason to refuse to arbitrate the subcriteria of criterion 11 shall allow jurors who in this court have a technical background to filter out certain types of tokens that are likely securities under swiss law as criterion 11 explicitly states failing one of the subcriteria implies being a security under swiss law this is a legal fiction that applies even if the token is in fact not a security 5 it is also not unlawful to apply criterion 115 even if it has nothing to do with a swiss regulation when applying for the badge the submitter is presented the primary document by submitting the application they enter into an arbitration agreement which says that they can loose the dispute if they fail to meet criterion 115 i discourage juror’s from refusing to apply a clause from the arbitration agreement that the parties entered into voluntarily 6 in some way this argument is similar to the argument about intellectual property the submitter made even if there is no way that

did not raise point 22 i argued 21 originally because the transactions moving funds to bitrex looked like foul play i think it is fair to say that while they do remain suspicious to me for many reasons i have pointed out and juror 2 also pointed out they have a reasonable enough explanation that i can withdraw this claim i have no serious proof they are improper persons and it is quite a serious charge on 31 a summary of my argument is as follows 311 the spend app is not a beta product for spendcoin it is all offchain and does not use any properties of the token nor does it ever intend to the app can be used normally without owning any spendcoin there are some ways you can use spendcoin for extra benefits but it is not a real use of the token just marketing to get people to buy and hold it a beta product for spendcoin would be spendchain which does not have a beta version 312 they recently open sourced some code but there is very little original code written so far it is

audit from a team that was also funded by the same venture studio consensys defines itself as a “mesh of quasi independent loosely coupled orgs” so in this circumstance the challenger believes that

instead of a literal buy back of tokens with fiat grid can be redeemed to remove the markup on electricity 1 grid removes markup of 500 kwh this is still a buy back because the holder can hand in his grid and in return he gets a discount of a specific amount of dollars reason number 3 we’ve seen that evidence submitted show that no proof of a third party audit existed at the time of submission and still doesn’t as consensys doesn’t seem to be a third party to me i furthermore agree with one of the jurors who commented earlier in the dispute “what really needs an audit is the entire twotoken

“has passed a thirdparty review” grid has actually fulfilled 41 in the safest way possible because of the three clauses undergoing a security audit is the most rigorous remember this fact security audits are more rigorous than third party reviews when we look at context let us now look at context it is fact that 41 is categorized under tradability the purpose of all of category 4 is to ensure that once listed on ethfinex the token can be tradable we can see that clauses 42 43 and 44 also ensure tradability a passed security audit public or not public ensures that the token is tradeable if you interpret that the audit must be public you are doing so because you are trying to make this process equitable this is not about an equitable process this is not about the challenger getting a “fair chance” this is about the criteria for listing a token finally let’s look at the evidence evidence has been submitted that the code was audited and the public was told about the audit this is in

need to talk about how providers of electricity ie utility companies gain market share in texas to avoid confusion when referring to a utility company we will capitalize utility whereas when referring to the grid token utility will remain lower case reason 1 in texas it is common practice for utilities to offer coupons to reduce prices and acquire customers these are commonly called “bill credits” you can see the use of such coupons here some plans advertise “w bill credit” grid is one of these coupons on blockchain this solves two problems a double spending and b predatory practices of utilities for how they can use “bill credits” see this blog post finally all of these coupons including grid cost the utility money texas is a deregulated market and all electricity must be bought at auction it is impossible to reduce that price therefore grid and all other coupons reduce the margin on electricity grid the utility is losing 23 per a grid redeemed ico price 115 vs current discount for customer 35 depending on plan you can see here that customers in texas are redeeming it is therefore impossible for the main purpose of grid to be fundraising if every redemption costs the company more than what they sold it for reason 2 the challenger admits in evidence that the following clauses are satisfied “there is a demand for the token driven by an existing or future utility this utility is obtained from obtaining holding participating or spending the token it is impossible for the third clause to be unsatisfied if the first two are satisfied the third clause here gives allowances for tokens that have had an ico but for which the utility is not yet available literally all that is needed to fulfill clause three of 32 is an “identified reason” for utility grid does

cryptocurrency including erc20 tokens hardware can run dapps the hardware then runs a dapp which always ensures the consumer can buy energy when they want at auction and that the consumer can always redeem grid they are effectively creating a decentralized network of hardware that purchases energy through their legal entity ie the utility in texas they will have no control over how customers buy energy or redeem grid on this layer there is the risk that their legal entity could go out of business or be stopped by some regulatory framework this risk is being mitigated by licensing this

auction this markup covers their costs eg administrative marketing and gives the utility profit grid is used to reduce the cost of that markup grid was sold not to primarily raise funds there are majority holders in the grid company whom invested without buying at the public ico but as a device to put these utility coupons onto the market so that when the utility went live they could acquire
