As such, all other submissions had to be split into individual files, and consequently renamed to the convention, but I initially saw no need to rename this file before submission, given that the filename has no actual significance to cryptographically verifiable claims of ownership."

Dumbledore becomes aware of the plot and confronts Malfoy, offering him a chance to back out and revealing the true extent of the danger and moral implications of his actions. However, Malfoy ultimately decides to go through with the assassination attempt, leading to a confrontation between Dumbledore and Malfoy.\nAfter considering all the evidence, the jurors would have to decide whether Malfoy was guilty of attempted murder or if he was acting under duress. The Kleros Court's decision would be final and binding, bringing a resolution to the dispute.\nGo to the Arbitrable Application",

It could be argued that Malfoy was under duress or fear of harm to himself or his loved ones if he did not comply with Voldemort's orders, and therefore, his actions should be considered involuntary. Additionally, it could be argued that the background provides little information on the specific details of the confrontation between Dumbledore and Malfoy and it is not clear if Malfoy was able to express his reluctance or if he was still under duress. In this view, it could be argued that Draco Malfoy should not be found guilty of attempted murder as his actions were not fully voluntary and he may not have had the intent to kill."

The profile picture is essential to guarantee the safety of this registry, as it is used by algorithms to detect duplicate accounts. Since the profile picture cannot correctly display the facial features of the registrant, algorithms cannot correctly do their work\nThis violates proof of humanity rules when \"- The picture should include the face of the submitter facing the camera and the\nfacial features must be visible.\"\n\n2) As if that was not enough of a case for the submitter to be disqualified, The video volume is way too low to understand what the submitter is saying and therefore clashes with the rules where\" The quality of the audio should be high enough such that the speaker can be understood clearly \". This video proves that it's not the case.\n\n3) The submitter Ethereum address is not easily readable. Due to the poor lighting conditions, the surface where the address was typed and the calligraphy of the submitter. Letters in the address cannot be distinguished and clash with each other. On numerous occasions, a number is confused with a letter.\nFor example, on the submitter address after the numbers 830 the video shows a letter G on the place where a number 6 should have been displayed. This is against the rules where: \"The sign should display in a readable manner the full Ethereum address of the\nsubmitter\",\n\nJurors, there are more than enough reasons to deny the acceptance of this submission into our beloved registry due to numerous mistakes on the submission. Please protect the integrity of the registry and vote NO.\n\nThanks very much,"

Moreover, the proportion and the shape of the submitter\u2019s nose in her profile picture is obviously different from her video.  The person in the profile picture doesn\u2019t look like the person in the video.\n\nTo conclude, this submission isn\u2019t in compliance with submission rule 2 Front-facing Submitter Picture: \u201cthe picture should include the face of the submitter facing the camera and the facial features must be visible\u201d. Thus it should be rejected. "

If it was not rebalanced then we are still owed 120 eth cover for which premium was paid in full up until May 9th. This situation would not have been raised, if rebalancing rules were clear and specifics were given by USF if they wanted to be so stringent on how policy should be rebalanced. We originally had 520 eth cover and premium paid in full till May 9th out of which only 400 ETH cover was paid out. So saying that cover was paid out in full is factually not accurate. After the rebalancing, we made our total cover from 520 to 680 eth across two policies for UST depeg event of which only 400 eth is claimed. 1217 is rejected  by saying it's a panic buy. That means the cover was added when depeg already started. By that logic , when depeg started we had 520 eth cover and only 400 eth was paid out.\n\nIn any insurance case, if the terms and conditions of the policy are not clear, it is generally granted in favor of the insured as the insured don't have any say in defining T&C. This case is for everyone to see how USF purposefully writes ambiguous policy documentation and finds every nook & corner to deny the cases when an insured event has happened. No written policy rules were violated and that remains the undisputed truth\n\nRuling in 1217 was nothing but unacceptable since Kleros' founder attacked the court and hijacked the 51% votes to rule on the case at his own discretion. One can dispute the events of the case are arguable but cannot dispute the fact that a fair hearing was not provided in the 1217 case. If the outcome of 1217 was by fair, transparent and independent jurors who do not have conflict of interest, we would have accepted the judgement and respected it. \n\nAlso please note case 1217 is sub judice now and court filings have already begun. We do not plan to appeal and fund the corrupt Kleros juror system anymore and that's why case was not appealed. However, we did make one last good faith attempt to settle the case and put this behind us by reducing the amount of eth and just asking for total ETH cover for UST depeg event for which premium was paid in full up until May 9th. However, completely opposite of what happens in real world insurance cases, USF and Kleros have relied on denying all disputable cases with brute force attacks on the court.\n\nOne can deny or accept the case, however, attacking the claimant who is merely trying to avail the service for which he/she paid for in full is preposterous. This is not the first time the Kleros system has relied on making attacks on the claimants itself who are fighting for their side of the story to avail the service they were promised and paid for in full. Same thing happened in case # 1170. This should be noted for future public records. \n\nWe understand the 120 eth cover was on Anchor + UST policy and this token is for UST policy. These tokens would not have been on UST policy if rebalancing rules were clear in the first place. If USF wanted us to rebalance in a certain way they could have easily provided the instructions but they failed to do so. Fact remains cover was for UST depeg at the end of the day and the claim is made against UST depeg event. Despite technicalities of the case, fact remains we had 520 ETH cover at minimum for UST depeg event and for which USF capital suppliers enjoyed the premium in whole. This was our last good faith attempt to put this behind us, however considering the current events, we will not back down to get a fair hearing on our case. "

They claimed that they were rebalancing an existing cover, yet they purchased an entirely different policy and the supposed rebalancing occurred over a week later than the maximum extent of the policy document\u2019s guidelines for rebalancing. There had already been news articles informing of a potential UST depeg published a full day before their UST Peg policy purchase.\n\nThroughout case 1217, there was never any question whether the amount of ETH claimed was incorrect, as the claimant\u2019s entire cover was invalid. Despite this, now that the original case has concluded with a ruling against them, the claimant utilized the Unslashed feature to adjust their claim amount. They chose a claim amount that when combined with their other claim (case 1216, Anchor + UST Peg Claim #32) totals the cover amount they once held on an entirely different policy. The claimant has already made a successful claim on their cover for this policy (again, see case 1216, Anchor + UST Peg Claim #32), and this case is an attempt to make an additional claim on that cover.\n\nIn adjusting their claim amount, the claimant also reset their appeal ETH deposit amount, the ONLY limiting factor in the amount of appeal rounds.\n\nDuring the previous case 1217, there were questions regarding whether the claimant had originally purchased their UST Peg cover in bad faith. In addition to this, the claimant has now potentially utilized the adjust claim amount feature in bad faith, is attempting to make a duplicate claim on their Anchor + UST Peg cover that has already been paid out, and reset the deposit amount needed for appeals.\n\nI agree with 0xEba0...1860, I urge the jury to account for all evidence presented in case 1217 when deciding the outcome of this case."

The evidence provided is a link to documentation which is clearly outdated and has no contractual weight in the first place.\n\nIn conclusion, if the claimant had \"rebalanced\" from the strictly more restricted UST policy to the more expensive Anchor UST policy, it would be fair (albeit somewhat unconventional) to accept this claim related to UST depegging. However, since the claimant switched to a cheaper policy and it appears that they did so only in order to cheap out on the insurer in anticipation of a UST depeg, a vote to reject this claim seems like the only appropriate choice."

If we knew depeg is going to happen, we would have converted everything to USD and not be looking for insurance for 280 eth as at the time of buying insurance 1 UST = $0.997 USD\n2) New Cover was bought as the ETH price fell down which constitutes rebalancing. Only criteria for rebalancing is it needs to be done in same wallet and not within same policy which was rightfully done\n3) We had UST peg cover already and we bought more UST peg cover due to falling eth price which constitutes as \"Newly added Cover\". \n4) It was rebalanced within 4 weeks of start of policy aligning with 2-4 weeks timeline\n5) Even one USF community member agreed that the rebalancing scenario is legit (Screenshot attached)\n6) Per policy \"Newly added cover as part of rebalancing is not subject to 10 days waiting period\" and hence our cover is not subject to 10 days waiting. \n\nPlease read the attached document carefully before arriving at a decision. Many lives are going to be impacted by this decision. Remember, If there is any doubt, then you need to give the benefit of doubt in favor of the insured and not the insurer as per insurance ambiguity principle applied in real world scenario. \n\nWe kindly request jurors to apply real world insurance principles here as it will help build right precedent and build trust in decentralized insurance. \n\nIf you accept this claim on basis of benefit of doubt, it will be win win for everyone as Unslahsed and kleros will have lot more business coming their way in coming future as more users be willing to trust Unslashed and Kleros which ultimately results in more profits for capital suppliers as well. Please have a long term outlook here v/s short term gains. \n\nDear Challenger,\nConsidering if you are willing to give us the benefit of doubt and request jurors to do so as well, we are happy to refund your challenge deposit + additional ETH so that you do not have to bear losses and make some profits as well.

If you review Unslashed terms, rebalances are NOT subject to the 10 day waiting period before the insurance period begins, so it was effective the day before the depeg started.\n\nFurthermore, I understand there was a concern that we got the insurance after the depeg began. This is not true, as the price of UST was $0.997 at the time we purchased the insurance. This is well within the normal historical fluctuations of the UST peg. It did not fall significantly until the next day.\n\nI am not trying to take advantage of the UST collapse here - I am a husband and soon to be father and if this claim is rejected again it will have a significant negative impact on our entire family. The only reason I was willing to risk placing our money into Anchor was because I was able to insure it. If this claim is rejected because of skepticism it will be quite devastating.\n\nI am requesting with your consideration of the information herein that you give my family the benefit of any doubt and vote to approve this claim. Please see the evidence attached earlier for additional information as well."

If one of the protocol members and core support member itself feels what we did was fine, it is equally ok for us to interpret the policy in that way. We sincerely request the jury members to consider the possibility of confusion that could have been caused by the policy and especially the UF's UI to rule the claim in our favor. The UI showed Anchor + UST as an umbrella policy which means UST is a subset. And what we did was just rebalance this UST only option. It is undeniable that UF could have done better job with the policy and we are a startup who cater to traditional investors. The outcome of this case is going to steer the trust among regular users in defi insurance and defi courts. We do not want our customers to lose trust. This is a sincere request from our end. Please read the evidence for more info. If needed, we can also provide further evidence about who we are and what we do as a startup."

I was able to use the Web app and submit from there, and I added the evidence of the transfer above.\n\nI sincerely apologize for inconvenience caused and cost incurred and the challenger\u2019s request of reimbursement for fees and gas is very reasonable and fair. I would be happy to accept the proposal and complete the transfer.\n\nI am not sure how to proceed here: whether there is a process to be followed to formally accept the offer (as it seems was done in case 1201) where I wait until voting and we go through it there, or if I should just send the challenger\u2019s wallet the payment and submit proof of that as evidence beforehand."

Claimants should include a screenshot of this banner in their evidence to prove the amount they were prompted to send matches proof transaction.\n\nThis claimant did not provide the banner or transaction hash for their proof transaction in their originally provided evidence, so I disputed their claim. After making my challenge deposit, the claimant added the banner, but claims they were unable to send their proof transaction to the address as instructed. I urge the claimant to get in contact with the Unslashed team as soon as possible to determine why they are unable to send their proof transaction to the provided address. The supplemental screenshots provided in the most recently posted evidence file are not enough to ascertain that the claimant owns the wallet in which the funds are located.\n\nFurthermore, in the event that the claimant is able to make the proof transaction, they still did not provide the required evidence until after I deposited 0.22 ETH as a claim deposit. Should the claimant provide the proof transaction and that be enough evidence to persuade the jurors to their side, I propose that the claimant be required to reimburse this deposit and gas (0.235 ETH). I made my challenge in good faith, and it is not my fault the claimant failed to provide the required evidence before my challenge. As such, I should not be required to bear this cost should they win their case. Unlike the settlement of Anchor + UST Peg claim # 15 (Kleros Case 1201) I seek only the reimbursement of my deposit plus gas rather than the claim deposit as well."

Yet, there has been no explanation as to why it is acceptable, legal, or ethical to apply NEW and arbitrary website UI terms to my claim retroactively instead of using the coverage policy document as stated on the Unslashed finance website and Kleros website. Both platforms have strayed away from their obligations and have chosen to act maliciously without integrity.\n\nTo the founders and team members of Kleros, your own published guidelines dictates that Jurors should only vote in regards to the published coverage policy provided by Unslashed, yet your actions and continual denial of this claim indicate that you have disregarded and contradicted your own guidelines when trying to enforce terms hidden in an obscure place in the web UI, of which I have provided proof that the website was modified AFTER my policy purchase.\n\nAt this point, Kleros has proven to be biased and fraudulent in its activities and involvement. All relevant case evidence have been documented, and your voting activities are immutably recorded on-chain, and will be used in my pursuit of justice using courts and law enforcement for all parties involved in committing this fraud if my claim is not accepted. \n\nIf you truly feel my claim should not be compensated in it's entirety, provide your evidence as to why for the public to view. Your silence and continual denial is acknowledgement that you are a willful participant in deceptive insurance and sham arbitration practices.\n\nSee attached demand letter."

The loss must simply relate to a severe and prolonged depeg as measured by the specified TWAP metric, and this was indeed the case.\n\n2. The policy covers losses \"related to\" the depeg event, not just the most restrictive interpretation of immediate/direct loss possible. The total loss incurred by the claimant in their leveraged position was undeniably \"related to\" the UST depeg and occurred under the specified .87$ price point in its entirety.  There are no exclusions for this case and ABSOLUTELY NO INDICATION that it was in the spirit of the policy to exclude indirect losses (very slightly indirect in this case).\n\n3. There is no mention in the primary document or the policy details that losses should be recalculated proportionally if the exposure was higher than the cover. Please remember that as per the General Court rules, jurors are to rule based on the contents of the primary document, and by extension in this case, on the policy details, since those are specifically referenced in the primary document. On the contrary, ad hoc instructions provided in the Unslashed UI are not relevant. Even more so in this case since (a) the instructions were provided at an unknown point in time after the policy had been purchased (and likely after the insured event) and with no warning to the policyholder, and (b) those details are not even clearly exposed in the UI since they are only displayed when hovering one's mouse cursor over the word \"ETH\".\n\nAs such, this claim can only be rejected by applying extreme bias in favour of the insurer, and doing so will only further damage Kleros' reputation as an impartial arbitrator.

                "title": "Jurors of Kleros",
                "description": "Hello Jurors of Kleros.\n\nI have previously addressed the challengers\u2019 points, but I would like to take this opportunity as\nrecommended by Pablo and Clement of the Kleros community to address the jurors on why my claim is\nvalid and should be fully compensated.\n\nI understand that each juror has their own perspective and opinions, so I would like to bring up a few\npoints for consideration. I firmly believe my claim is valid as I have met all the conditions as stated in the\npolicy, starting from UST ownership prior to policy start, a valid policy past the depeg event, and proof of\nloss. I am not entirely sure what each juror's viewpoints are regarding the interpretation of the policy. I\nam not here to say anyone is wrong in their views, but I would like to also point out my viewpoints are\nalso not wrong for the following reasons:\n\n1. The policy was written to be broad since the team has acknowledged it is difficult to account for\nevery scenario that is possible, especially if it has not yet occurred.\n2. The policy was written, and I quote \"What\u2019s insured? - any UST or aUST assets, or any\ndebt/borrowing positions, held on a centralized, decentralized exchange, a Terra wallet or any\nother blockchain wallet, of which ownership prior to the policy period can be proven through\ndeposits, message signing, trading activity, any onchain transactions or other verifiable means.\"\nThis tells me the intent is to cover the UST depegging loss in any form, the UST token itself, aUST\nassets, and any debt/borrowing positions that could be stored on a centralized/decentralized\nexchange, or any other blockchain wallet if we can prove ownership. My situation may not be as\ncommon as the other claimants, but it is still specifically listed as one of the covered conditions\nunder the policy wording debt/borrowing positions clause. I have also met the other 3 main\nrequirements to be eligible which is a loss related to the UST-US depeg, the TWAP event that has\noccurred which I am sure everyone can agree that UST will not be re-pegging, and my loss did in\nfact occur during the policy period.\n\nI believe the only point of contention is my debt/borrowing position. To which I would like to emphasize,\nit is clearly stated as covered according to the policy document, and that the policy makes no mention\nthat there should be any special considerations for debt/borrowing positions, just like in the case of\n#1208 and #1212 where they were challenged due to the LUNA2 airdrop. However, the Jurors were just\nand honest and voted to approve those two claims as the policy document made no mention that any\nairdrops/compensation would impact their claim. So, to be consistent with that line of thinking, my claim\nis also valid since the policy document contains clear criteria for claim eligibility and does not make any\nmention of exceptions regarding debt/borrowing positions either. It is simply listed as one of the covered\nscenarios. The policy document cannot be modified after an event, especially during a claim. And since\nmy claim meets all of the criteria clearly laid out in the policy that I purchased, force majeure cannot\napply to my claim either.\n\nThe principle of contra proferentem applies in which the courts interpret ambiguous terms in a coverage\npolicy against the coverage provider in favor of the policyholder. This rule originates from the fact that\ncoverage policies consist of non-negotiable language set forth by the coverage provider. It has been long\nestablished that the rule of contra proferentem applies with even greater force where the ambiguity\noccurs in an exclusion because the burden of proof lies not with the claimant, but with the coverage\nprovider to show where the exclusion applies. A notable example of integrity and ruling in favor of the\nclaimant was when Nexus Mutual paid out over 1000 ETH to a claimant with no actual losses, because\nthe policy did not stipulate they must suffer a loss just that they had to have a valid policy, and to meet\nevery other condition listed in the policy and the claim was paid out.\n\nI do believe that Unslashed Finance has potential with their novel idea of the Spartan bucket which\nminimizes the losses a capital supplier would lose in the event of claims, and that disputes would be\nresolved through Kleros for fair and just arbitration. Since this policy has ambiguity, this would be an\nopportunity for the Kleros court to demonstrate to the community that it will always honor contra\nproferentem, just like any bonafide court system. In this case, since there is no exclusion that losses from\ndebt/borrowing positions would be considered and compensated differently than any other UST or aUST\nasset losses, it would not be just or fair to assume that it would be covered differently since it is not\nstated in the policy.\n\nIf this claim is approved, then it would instill confidence for people with considerably larger portfolios\nand funds than myself to go with Unslashed/Kleros as their coverage provider and arbitrator, since its\npractices would align with the practices from courts of law. This would positively result in greater\nrevenue for capital suppliers, and larger cases and fees to the Kleros Jurors in the event of a dispute.\n\nThis last month has been a tough time for everyone involved, the claimants, the capital suppliers, and\nthe Jurors but I hope we can all work hard to put this all behind us. I have provided clear reasons and\nevidence to accept the claim due to meeting all of the requirements as laid out in the policy. If any of\nthe jurors have any questions, I will be glad to address them. Thank you for your time and consideration."

Let me begin by noting that the policy document linked above, which is decisive here, says nothing whatsoever about reimbursements offsetting losses and, therefore, claims. In the absence of any statement to this effect, the court must rule in my favor.\n \n2.  To play devil\u2019s advocate, the policy document linked above does end by saying, \u201cWe may change this insurance policy in order to make it match new market conditions when necessary.\u201d My challenger seems to assume that the policy was in fact changed\u2014in particular, he/she seems to assume that the policy was changed so as to include something like the following clause: \u201cReimbursements from the Terra Foundation, LFG or any other third party will also be taken into account during the claims as they can influence the losses.\u201d (https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmWCheS5PehtSBZASsPVNS6KdLDHyqXv2rLZ5acB26QSGz) In fact, however, the policy was never changed, governance never voted on any such change in policy, so the challenger is simply mistaken if he/she assumes that reimbursements are to be \u201ctaken into account\u201d during the claims. They aren\u2019t and the challenge must be deemed frivolous.\n \nThe previous two points are, I believe, decisive. There is simply no mention in the policy document of reimbursements, and there is absolutely no guidance in the policy document on how reimbursements should affect the claim. However, I will add some further considerations in support of my case.\n \n3.  My claim was made on May 24th, which was before the May 27th snapshot and the airdrop.\n \n4.  As you can see from my wallet, I always had around UST 1.850.000 UST tokens on Anchor. When the depeg started on May 9th, I kept almost all of my funds on my Terra wallet (I was only able to sell around UST 50.000 on Okx). At the time of the claim, the balance was around UST 1.800.000 and my coverage was for USD 1.000.000 (485 eth). So this means that there were UST 850.000 that were not covered by the insurance policy that are being considered by the challenger as part of the airdrop that should be deducted, but since they were not covered by the insurance, they shouldn't be taken in consideration. Also, as you know the largest portion of my airdrop was on behalf of holding the UST on pre attack and, since there was a UST 500.000 Whale cap, I can say that most of the awards were received by the UST that were not covered, so they shouldn't be considered for this reason as well. All Txs and dates to prove this can be checked on the accountability attachment included in the case.\n \n5.  The vested fund cannot be taken in consideration. Since nobody will know the price of Luna 2 in 5 years, it is impossible to predict the equivalent amount. It can very well be 0 by the time it is liquid.\n \n6.  Many claims have been already approved without taking reimbursements from Terra into consideration. I don't see why my case should be treated differently.\n "

Ownership on terra address prior to depeg can not guarantee the claimant did not sell UST at higher prices and thus, can't guarantee that the amount is not inflated. \n\n The correct way here would be to Reject this incomplete claim (ceding original ~ 0.722 ETH to the challenger), then use Unslashed \"adjust claim amount\" functionality to resubmit the same claim again (it is only possible to do once) with a lower amount (if the amount actually has to be the same, they can just lower it by 1 wei) and a more complete evidence. This would require another ~ 0.722 ETH deposit which would, upon \"Accept\" return back to the claimant. \n\n In total, the claimant stands to lose 0.722 ETH and the challenger stands to gain that amount (minus 0.22 that the challenger paid for the Kleros dispute). This would be the correct flow of such claim and this is why it's not about 0.22 ETH, but about ~ 0.722 ETH which the challenger was hunting for. \n\n In the previous settlement proposal the challenger asked to perform this transfer of ~ 0.722 ETH right away to save time. At this moment the challenger understands, that although this would save claimant's time, it's not 100% guaranteed that jurors will vote Reject and thus for the settlement it would be better to offer a lower amount so that the claimant stands to gain something from accepting the settlement. Therefore the new proposal is 75% of the amount in question. By accepting the settlement proposal, the claimant transfers 0.5415 Ether to the challenger and thus gains back 25% of the amount he would stand to lose if the claim goes by its normal flow, the challenger gets back 25% less than they expected, but is sure of the outcome and doesn't have to take a chance with the Kleros court. \n\n I hope the claimant sees it as a fair proposal this time and understands that by accepting it, they gain some money back, compared with what they would normally stand to lose for their mistake. \n\n To the jurors: a transfer of an amount or 0.5415 Ether to the address 0x2343E74A17a70503e1c62D808c8c2ABFaC926Ace would mean a withdrawal of motion to Reject based on initial evidence and a green light to rule based on the complete updated evidence."

With the addition of the Secret Key on the Binance API, it is also clear actual loss was suffered, and that no sale was even done prior to the claim.  \n\n The accounting spreadsheet merely recounts the onchain history of the wallet which only simply had aUST and UST transactions and makes it easier to read. \n\n Therefore, with the evidence provided: \n* It is clear the ownership of the assets prior to the policy period has been established. Onchain data on the terrawallet, message signing, as well as binance apis proved this history \n * It has satisfied the requirements set forth  to consider the loss, as evidenced by the transaction data in Binance: \n\n ● the loss is related to UST-US dollar peg, UST trading below $0.87 on CMC,\n Coingecko or other reputable sources; and \n ● the loss on UST-US dollar peg results in a TWAP, based on market data \n extracted from reputable sources, below $0.87 in a two-week span at least; \nand \n ● the loss occurred during the policy period. \n\n * Such loss is even greater than the claimed amount. \n\n * Claimant willing to compensate challenger a fair value for challenging the claim in good faith."

I agree that there should be some compensation for claims such as this where the evidence in the blockchain and the API key, while valid, was not provided in a complete manner at the onset (missing Secret Key). While it would have been better that there is a functionality for this on chain instead of negotiating it here via messages, I will agree to compensate you for your costs plus some premium. \n\n Based on onchain data, I make the presumption that approximate 0.22 ETH was used to challenge this claim. Given the losses we have already suffered on our side, I propose to compensate you for 0.3(+gas fees) ETH if this will cover your loss plus some gain. If you should accede to such a request, I will send the amount and the evidence in the subsequent message. I hope that the jurors will rule appropriately, as this agreement cannot be an assurance anyway on my side. While I am confident that if ruling accordingly, the evidence included here contain the right data for the jurors to rule in my favor, I cannot discount that you would indeed suffer a loss from my mistake, so I willing will compensate you for that. \n\n I hope you would accept this. \n\n I again attach here proof of my transactions, and additional evidence that proves that the API will display the deposits and trades made as described in the accounting sheet. \n\nThank you."

                "description": "Based on all the information currently provided by the claimant, it should be rejected on the following reasons.\n\n1) Because they failed to provide evidence of a loss.  Now, I know what your thinking.  If a user is attempting to claim rewards and the rewards are not paid out to that user, thats something that should qualify as a claim and get paid out, right?  You are correct in that regard.  However, this user did not provide us with his waves address, nor of any transactions in question on the Waves blockchain.  Without that, we cannot rule out the possibility of malicious intent.  Heres an example.  If the user were to create a transaction to claim the rewards, and then he canceled/replaced his transaction with something else that was confirmed on chain, most EVM based dapps, will provide an error message of some sort because the transaction the dapp expected, is not what was confirmed.\n\n1a) I would strongly encourage all claimants provide the full error message when submitting documents to Kleros.  In this case,  at least half the error is missing and is difficult to interpet as-is.\n\n2) While not explicitly stated, all claims should be made in good faith, and just like in real life, the user should attempt to resolve the issue between themselves and Vires, before escalating to any court when possible. I believe this user should have contacted Vires, via their in-site support system (powered by intercom see attachment) to get a team member to review the error message and to correct it for them (and potentially other users as well)\n\n3) As per the Unslashed Claims Acceptance Policy listed here:  https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmeTBY7jZe2ut5WjifNASADo3E4zBxkMd62WwBpXtwP9pg here is the quote in question, I think applies to this user \n\n\u201cis due to external inputs such as oracles - including price feed manipulation - or miner behavior, network congestion, etc. which didn\u2019t operate as intended but the covered Smart Contract Network continued to behave as intended; or\u201d\n\nAs mentioned in 1 above, the user did not provide us with their waves address, and I posit that the user could have created the vires claims transaction with 0 waves as gas and it was their expectation that the transaction would be approved an confirmed as intended, albeit on a delay.  But their transaction would never get confirmed if there were always transactions with a higher gas available in the mempool.  So if their transaction got bounced from the mempool, this would be due to a standard network congestion event, and not a vires issue - especially since this issue seems to be impacting only a singular user and not a systemic, widespread issue that would garner media attention, such as USDN Depegging did.\n\n4) Even if we are being extremely generous here, and assuming that all points above are ignored, the maximum damage they suffered, would be equal to the amount they were unable to claim, which is the $38.59 of assets in Vires, which is not currently worth 2 ETH, that they are claiming.  According to the on chain evidence from their Ethereum wallet ( https://etherscan.io/tx/0x9fd5b8808e696643cc5fbee86a25b6b8193ae3e8ba8385a06d719e2d1d6273bc ) they filed approx 33 hours ago and ETH\u2019s price was $2,635.19 / ETH per Etherscan.  The user is asking for $38.59 the amount they were unable to claim + 5231.79 in damages for a total of = $5270.38.\n\nBased on the above points, we should reject this users request, until they are able to provide some evidence of loss as of a result of using Vires.  They have been unable to do so, and such, the 2 ETH claim should be rejected."

It would simply be enough to ONLY mention the field could be any UTF8 Character if the intention was for the field to serve more as a 'name/title' for the submission rather than a name representing the actual submitter. Additionally, looking at the examples in the PoH guidelines for that name almost exclusively feature obviously meaningful names. \n\nI do think very short names or name that resemble gibberish may sometimes be considered as valid names... but given the broader context between this submission and the related submissions with the same background present in their images, I agree with the argument that its very likely these names were randomly chosen and are not names by which any of them go by.

The following is a transcript of the video.\n\nOn April 1st, 2022, Mr Avraham Eiseinberg purchased \u201cVires Finance USDN\u201d insurance cover on the Unslashed Finance Platform. On April 6th, 2022, Mr. Eisenberg claimed that his insurance entitled him to compensation of $16,338 from Unslashed capital providers including the \u2018Spartan Bucket\u2019 for alleged speculative losses which occurred hours after the insurance was purchased. On April 13th, the claim was challenged, and a dispute was created in the Kleros court. The cover policy clearly states that \u201c[t]he policy begins after an initial waiting period of 10 days.\u201d The claim was made for alleged \u201closses\u201d which occurred in the first 28 hours of insurance purchase. Therefore, the policy had not begun since the initial 10 day waiting period had not elapsed, hence the premature claim must be rejected. Mr. Eisenberg further claims that at the time of purchase, the specific insurance cover policy was absent, and the label \u201ccoming soon\u201d was displayed on the Unslashed insurance marketplace website. The cover policy, as indicated to buyers, was soon updated and was available by the time the dispute was created. Kleros general court policy clearly states that jurors should base their rulings on court policies as they \u201cexist at the time of the creation of the dispute.\u201d Therefore, any reasonable interpretation of the case derives its rules from the cover policy document. Moreover, Mr. Eisenberg bought the insurance with full knowledge that the terms of the insurance were coming soon. Any reasonable interpretation of this question resolves to an answer of reject. Remember, if the timeline does not fit, you must convict. Vote reject on Kleros case 1170"

We therefore disagree with MIZU's argument that it should be read as it may be rejected. \n\nWe therefore put aside the policy period as the claimant waited weeks before getting the actual wave's vires USDN policy. We still think we should reject the claim because of the nature of the gateway.\n \nIndeed Wave's gateway is a centralized payment solution that allows transferring cryptocurrencies from one blockchain to another and vice versa; as well as transferring fiat money to and out of the blockchain. \nhttps://docs.waves.exchange/en/waves-exchange-glossary#g\n\nSo no smart contract is involved except for the minting/burning/transfer of USDN and this was working.

                "description": "First, they claim that \"the current document has stayed the same since the dispute was created.\" \n\nPlease note, when this claim was first made on Apr 6th, the policy with a waiting period was not publicly available. I provided multiple pieces of evidence for this, including a chat with the Unslashed CEO asking for the policy (which he repeatedly refused to provide), and a screenshot of the UI showing the link to the PDF was broken. While several of the evidence submissions claim that this policy was available earlier, not a single one of them offers *any* evidence for this claim. I encourage anyone curious about this to join the Unslashed discord and read through the discussion prior to Apr 6th, which makes it clear it was not available at that time, nor at the time the insurance was purchased. By voting to reject this claim on the basis of this document that was not available at the time, you would be destroying trust in Kleros as an objective arbitrator that users could trust to handle disputes. Users would need to worry that new documents would be created and ruled by Kleros to retroactively apply, causing them to not only lose the case, but also lose their bond and court fees that were paid in good faith. \n\n>This case has so many reasons to be rejected that it's hard to be concise:\n- The first and most obvious reason to reject this claim is that there was no incident. According to customer support \"the gateway worked in standard mode\". Actually even\nMizu chat with the customer support (evidence provided by the claimant) indicates that \"Some transactions may be subject to additional security processing. This is a\nstandard security measure. Any transaction can be sent for additional processing for security purposes.\".\n\nI previously submitted a screenshot showing Waves support saying the maximum bridge time is one hour. Choosing to ignore that in favor of more recent statements, after this high profile bridge delay, is motivated reasoning. \n\n>- The Kleros rules ask for jurors to consider the primary document and state of the world at the time of dispute creation which points to a document excluding the loss as\nnot being within the cover period and being due to external outputs.\n- Even if you believe that the old \"Coming soon\" document would apply, this document would reference the new document, not the absence of any exclusions.\n- Even if you believe that the old \"Coming soon\" does not refers to the new one, this document would not provide any cover of the bridge as the bridge is not mentioned\nin this document, nor in UI, nor in the title of the insurance. Without the new document there would be no basis for bridge coverage (contrary Vires and USDN which\nare present in the UI and insurance title).\n\nAgain, you are choosing to ignore the evidence submitted that Unslashed promoted this insurance policy as covering the bridge. \n\n- The potential delays are explicitely mentioned in the terms of services. Here a customer support representative indicated that the transaction was flagged for security.\nDue to it's high amount (over 1 000 000 $) and the fact the addresses and funds are linked to an exit scam that the claimant himself committed, it is very likely that the\ndelay was due to claimant immoral acts and he is was lucky that the funds were ultimaltely processed and not sized.\n\nPlease note that the suggestion any \"exit scam\" took place is wrong. A redemption was carried out in March, allowing all holders the opportunity to exit. Please see (https://snowtrace.io/address/0x79b8be17b745ce3febafa153e4a478cd81d9b026 and https://snowtrace.io/address/0xb4c2f4be2f610ee3689f903c6272316c5c3bc50c) for on chain evidence, and (https://snapshot.org/#/fortressdao.eth/proposal/0x8d6eae73647d31c7749d22a6acbc1012f8ce86882fc9f1cd3ca2c1a5e1ed0555 and https://snapshot.org/#/fortressdao.eth/proposal/0xe40d34813417bddea0a307ac730c3be0da5f0eed9852ff8cc14f426117a3753d) for details on the votes that authorized this redemption.\n\nPlease also note that this conspiracy theorizing about why the bridge was unavailable is directly contradicted by the fact that multiple other people had issues with the bridge on the same day. See e.g. https://twitter.com/kollisuresh/status/1510270312172355590 and https://twitter.com/oz_onpu/status/1510300231908220928. There was clearly a more widespread unavailability issue, not the speculative theory they offer with little evidence.\n\n- The claimant didn't lose any fund by using the bridge, he put some USDN in, he got the right amount of USDN out. No assets were lost.\n- The claimant strategy (borrowing USDN and selling it, which is shorting USDN) led him to 465 057$ of profit. If the bridge had been faster, he could have gotten a few\nthousands more, but if the bridge was not there he couldn't have executed this strategy (as there wasn't enough liquidity on Waves of his own admission).\nThe bridge worked and allowed the claimant to make huge profits with his strategy, so any \"loss\" he is claiming there is not a real loss but only a \"loss of opportunity\" he\nwould have had would the bridge have been faster.\n\nThis is false. They only count transactions on the eth side but not on the waves side; as of now I've put more money in than I've gotten out.  Please note, if the bridge had not existed then I would not have deposited USDC and borrowed USDN at all, since I would not have been able to sell the USDN, and then I would not have lost any funds using this strategy. They also suggest elsewhere that I should have repaid the USDN and waited to recover my USDC. However, that would have been a highly risky strategy, since there was no guarantee that USDC liquidity would ever come back, and, in fact, as of now Vires has implemented strict withdraw limits to prevent users like me from withdrawing their capital. Had I followed the strategy suggested here, I would have lost an additional million dollars in Vires, in a manner I have no doubt 0x177b would argue is uninsurable were I to try to file a claim on it now. The suggestion that I didn't really lose money, because I could have followed a different strategy that would have led to a complete loss in reality, seems absurd. \n\n- The delay of 28h is pretty low, both by classic financial system standard, blockchain bridge standard or exchange withdrawal standard.\n\nThis has already been addressed.\n\n- The amount claimed for a delay is way too high, even if jurors were to agree to a compensation, a fair compensation would have been the \"cost of capital\" (how much\nit would have cost to borrow the USDN for this period or the yield the USDN would have generated). Giving a compensation on what the claimant \"could have done\" if\nthe bridge was faster doesn't make sense as it would require speculating on what the claimant would have done. Jurors believing this to be the case should reject the\nclaim and then accept the readjusted one.\n\nNo speculation is required, I am simply comparing the dollar value at the time the bridge was initiated to the dollar value at the time it was completed. \n\n- Now even if you disagreed with all of the above, the compensation calculation isn't still right. This is due to the fact that the claimant didn't have enough cover to cover\nall the funds in Vires + the bridge. The claimant had at least 9 251 917 $ of USDC in Vires when the bridge finished while having only 1 000 ETH of cover\n(3 282 000$). According to UI which specifies \"Note that if you suffered a loss on an exposure higher than your cover, your loss will be recalculated proportionally.\", in\ncase of overexposure loss has to be calculated proportionally, so the compensation should be at least (there may be more exposure I haven't looked at) divided\nby 925917 / 328000 = 2.81 leading to at most 5.1 / 2.81 = 1.81 ETH of compensation.\nJurors believing this should reject the claim and then accept the readjusted one.\n\nThe UI did not state this at the time the insurance was purchased, nor at the time the claim was made. I am unable to find it in the current UI. \n\n- If even after that you had rejected all the previous arguments, the amount would still not be correct. He sold USDN for 0.995 the day of the alleged incident. But he\nactually sold way more decreasing the price down to 0.989. So even if he had gotten a better price for the bridged funds, he would have gotten a worse price for the other\nUSDN he sold himself. So the total \"loss\" would have been (0.989-0.979)*1000003=10 000$, only 2/3 of what he claimed, so the claim would need to be rejected and only\nthe readjsuted claim accepted.\n\nThis is making assumptions about liquidity in a hypothetical that are purely speculative. The price went down over time, which is why a working bridge was essential to my strategy.  Again, the simplest and most natural way to calculate loss is by looking at market prices at the time. (In fact, if the bridge had been working properly, I would likely have done many of my swaps earlier while USDN was priced higher, and thereby saved significantly more than the 5.2 eth claimed. Since I had to wait on each amount bridged in order to loop further, I would have been able to finish the entire looping process over several hours instead of multiple days. while USDN was still very close to peg.)

The transaction was flagged by a neural network (machine learning algorithm they use to detect suspicious transactions) and sent for additional security processing.\nMy belief is that the transaction was flagged due it being:\n- A high amount.\n- Linked to accounts involved in the Fortress DAO exit scam.\n\nIndeed, it was possible to trace back Avraham (the claimant and the Fortress DAO exit scammer) wallet to the incident. It's likely that the exit scam was reported and that the security technology that the waves.exchange uses took this reports into account and sent the transaction for additional processing.\n\nFinally, the transaction was still processed (probably after a manual review).\n\nNote that even if you don't believe that Avraham exit scammed, the fact that people reported it as such would likely have been taken into account by the transaction flagging algorithm.\nMoreover, the support indicated that any transaction can be sent for additional processing and the terms of service also indicates it:\n\"The Company may, at any time and in its sole discretion, within its technical capabilities, restrict access to the Exchange Gateways services to any User, User address and crypto-assets, impose limits on input and output of Tokens, restrict services from certain locations, require completion of KYC procedure\".\n\nThe support also indicated that the gateway worked \"in standard mode\" thus that there was no incident.\n\nIn order to already anticipate objections stating that this is new evidence. The customer support chat has been available from the start and jurors are welcome to ask questions by themselves (https://waves.exchange/ on bottom right).

The customer support link is publicly available and it is reasonable to ask the team of the platform where an alleged incident occurred if they think it's a normal behavior or an incident.\nI encourage jurors not trusting the screenshot I put to go and ask there by themselves (https://waves.exchange/ bottom right corner).\n\nNote that I am not the challenger but a juror who saw something he believed to be wrong and made its inquiry. I think Kleros should favor jurors doing due diligence on cases and sharing their findings.\n\nThe fact that delays happen time to time and that the claimant has bought insurance just before transferring large amount of funds through the bridge (using most of the \"liquidity\" of the bridge) makes me think that the claimant knew that this could result in a delay and tried to abuse the insurance this way.\n\nHowever we thanks the claimant for reminding us of this rule.\nThe claimant only submitted this https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmZcAYWEy23fxbmxNRgLKT78BNHJcueNtFYFpTbrPsZvyG (chat saying the policy was not public) as its initial claim.\nHe only waited after the claim was challenged (7 days after being made which let the claimant ample time to submit details about the claim) to provide information about an alleged loss.\nThis means that challengers could only base their decisions to challenge based on information that could have reasonably be readily and publicly available to them.\nObviously claimants can't fail to explain their claim and only provide a claim after it has been challenged, this would render the whole claimant/challenger system ineffective as challengers could not know what they should challenge.\nThe Unslashed general rules state.\n\" Who can submit a claim?\nAny Ethereum address which owned the insurance token of the Unslashed Cover in question at least one block prior to the occurence of the event covered (as defined in each cover policy) then uses it to file a claim.\"\nThe claim is what is shown as the first evidence.

Failing to put the document online before the policy can be accessed to is far from a \"immoral act\" (at best negligence) in regard to the examples of the general court policy.\nMoreover here Unslashed is the protocol sending claim disputes to Kleros, not a party of the dispute. The parties are Avraham and the Spartan Bucket, not Unslashed.\n\n> Please note that what I am asking is to enforce public marketing from Unslashed, and the public documents that were available.\nIf Kleros were to reward such gamesmanship, it would destroy trust in any protocols using Kleros, as users would justifiably be concerned that the documents applying to their claims could change at any moment, including after cases began.

Documents applying to claims cannot change after the cases begin as the general court policy states \"Rulings should be made based on the \u201cstate of the world\u201d at the time a dispute was created.\"\nAvrah took an insurance while he couldn't see the policy while perfectly knowing there was some exclusions.\n\n> If Kleros were to reward such gamesmanship, it would destroy trust in any protocols using Kleros, as users would justifiably be concerned that the documents applying to their claims could change at any moment, including after cases began.

In order to borrow more USDN to continue the strategy, I needed to deposit more USDC, which required waiting for the bridge to complete, selling USDN, and then bridging in USDC. I did not have access to USDN to sell while waiting for the bridge. In fact, looking at the screenshot posted, you can see that the 405k USDN was deposited about an hour and a half after the previous USDN bridge was finally sent through. I sold it for USDC, bridged and deposited the USDC to Vires, and then borrowed more USDN to continue with the leveraged strategy. \n\nNote that I could not have simply repaid the USDN and withdrawn my USDC to avoid a loss, because Vires did not have liquidity for USDC withdraws at the time (which was why the interest rate was so high, making this strategy attractive.)

However, the policy was only publicly available more than a week after the loss, after I made repeated requests to the team, and after I filed this claim, as the record demonstrates. \n\nTo be clear, this claim should be accepted simply because it is valid under the public policy that applies. Nobody is being penalized. The insurers had access to the same information I did when purchasing insurance, so they would not have been counting on these private exclusions in the first place. \n\nRegarding their claim that a period of unavailability is not covered, the exact portion of the policy that covers this was discussed in prior evidence submissions. To excerpt, losses resulting from \"unavailability or failure to access or process these covered smart contracts\" is covered."

We cannot penalize a party due to mistakes made by another.\n\nD) Even if the policy were not to apply, we would have to look at the general policy for Unslashed https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmeTBY7jZe2ut5WjifNASADo3E4zBxkMd62WwBpXtwP9pg , it only covers losses, not delays in transaction execution."

It\u2019s under the guideline:\n\u27a4 Expand significantly the Kleros knowledge base (explaining the juror process, the flow and structure of dapps that integrate Kleros, the court process, etc).\n\nI believe that if my goal is to explain the integration of Kleros, it is important to first explain what the integration is and what its features are before explaining how Kleros Tokens plays an important role in it. Otherwise, people may not understand the entire goal of the video if they do not understand what the integration is and what its features are. After that, the remainder of the video goes into the topic of the tokens registry and how it\u2019s being utilized. This is my own personal approach in introducing and inviting individuals to use Kleros. \n\nSee attach document below"

That is definitely more than the three coin listing sites mentioned by the submitter (the jurors are free to check).\n\nIf we also go by quality, it\u2019s clear that exchanges are more important as that is where the actual trading is done, and they all still use the name \u201cMainframe\u201d when referring to the token (and that is not only minor exchanges, but Binance and Uniswap too).\n\n\n2) Are we adding tokens or projects to this list?\nIf we are adding tokens, like we should, the name has to be Mainframe. That is because there is no Hifi token yet, and there won\u2019t be until the swap is done.

As you know, none of which was taken into court for considerations of the jury as none perhaps have noticed your use of others contents until now. No challenge > No juror decision > No precedent. \nIf you were challenged on the 2nd video submission for the challenge reason stated, does your 1st video acceptance set an example for the 2nd to be accepted without question? Clearly, no.

This point here is not really clear.\n\n\n2. \u201cIt\u2019s as if saying that adding 2017 dead ICO tokens now to the registry is considered valid - which doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nIf we follow the policy and the TCR precedents, there is no doubt that even 2017 dead ICO tokens can be added, since token activity, swap status or use case are not basis for rejection. This is a token registry, the fact that the tokens are not actively traded or inactive does not matter, as the policy explicitly says.\n\n\n3. \u201cThe invalidity of these inverse tokens can also be confirmed here https://www.synthetix-monitoring.com/\u201d\n\nWhat does \u201cinvalidity\u201d mean in this case and what is this page supposed to prove? We already knew the tokens were frozen, as we can see on the page, but as said before this is not considered a basis for rejection in the official policy.\n\n\n4. \u201cApparently you can\u2019t swap it through Uniswap as the submitter claims, because only inverse BTC is the only inverse token that hasn\u2019t \u201creached its limits and gets frozen\u201d.\u201d\n\nThis is once again false, every single ethereum token can be swapped on uniswap if there is liquidity available. \n\nNow there is a very important point that has already been made in the previous piece of evidence that apparently went unnoticed to the challenger: the fact that the token is frozen only means that it\u2019s price will not change on the SNX exchange and that new ones cannot be issued. The frozen tokens that are currently in circulation can still be traded for other synths, redeemed for sUSD or traded on secondary markets. This has already been proven in the previous piece of evidence as the official SNX documentation clearly says referring to inverse synths: \u201cIf it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen, it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths at its frozen value.\u201d (proof of this can be found attached in the previous piece of evidence). So the claim by the challenger that these tokens can no longer be traded is false, otherwise people would find themselves stuck with a useless token after big price movements, unable to redeem or exchange it."

The first one: \u201cZilliqa(ZIL) was an ERC20 token before its mainnet token launched and so are Aeternity(AE) or Wanchain(WAN). Will we allow tokens in the non-eth chain to be listed here due only to project owners expressing an intention to create an eth-based counterpart or only when that token is live on eth mainnet?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t see how this point applies to the case in question. All the synths have always been only on eth and there have been no token swaps to other chains. On top of that we also do allow wrapped versions of non-eth tokens to be listed, in our case the tokens are already live on mainnet so I don\u2019t see the point.\n\n\n2. On the topic of contract addresses: \u201cMy stand to reject the listing is also supported by policy line#4 on the importance of checking contract addresses. There were many listing updates in the past for token contracts that were old/deprecated and replaced with a new listing with the new token contract.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t apply in our case, it would be correct only if we already had a new version of these inverse synths, but we don\u2019t. The synths submitted are the most recent versions of the token, and as such the one that should be listed in the TCR. This point can only be valid if and when a new version of these synths is live.\n\n\n3. The challenger also says \u201cHave you actually tried swapping any of these submitted frozen inverse synths to other synths? I did. And none of your submissions can be swapped, only iBTC- as what the synth monitoring link I sent was about.\u201d\n\nThe challenger is claiming that he tried swapping these inverse synths but was been unable to do so, I find that very hard to believe for a few reasons. First of all only people that already own the asset could have done the swap, as we saw in the previous pieces of evidence. The chances of the challenger having some are low, but if that was the case I am sure that he could point us to his wallet and transaction where he tried to do these swaps?\n\nBut most importantly, if we go by SNX documentation the challenger claim is clearly false, since you can swap the assets back to other synths or sUSD even if frozen, otherwise what would be the point of such an asset that if the price moves too much you are stuck with it forever and unable to redeem it? \n\nSNX is clear on this, and quoting their documentation: \u201cIf it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen, it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths at its frozen value.\u201d This leaves no doubts, the asset can still be redeemed for sUSD or swapped to other synths, the only frozen thing is its value and issuance.\n\nOnce again you will find the evidence proving that you can in fact swap your inverse assets even if frozen in the attached document."

                "description": "There are a few points to be made here, all of them are also valid for the 4 similar cases currently active in the token listing court:\n\n1. First and most important, the TCR policy is clear in cases like this one:\n\u201cRequests are not to be denied listing based on token creation date, token swap status (with non-ethereum chains), use case or token activity.\u201d\n\nThe policy clearly states that requests are not to be denied based on token activity, creation date, use case or swap status. Thus the fact that the token is currently frozen on the SNX exchange (main point of the challenger) cannot be a reason for rejection. This is a valid token on the ethereum network, if we follow the TCR policy (as we should) it can and should be added to the TCR.\n\n\n2. The previous point alone would be enough to prove that the submission should be accepted, but there is more to be said:\nThe challenger argues that the token cannot be traded and is useless in its current state, this is false. You can read on the official SNX pages referring to inverse synths:\n\u201cIf it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen, it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths at its frozen value.\u201d (evidence for this is in the attached document)\n\nThe only limitation is on new purchases, it can still be traded for other synths, traded on secondary markets (like uniswap) or redeemed for sUSD. It is by no means a \u201cuseless token\u201d as the challenger says.\n\n\n3. The precedents are clear, all the other SNX inverse synths are already listed on the TCR (the jurors can check for themselves by searching for \u201cSynthetic Inverse\u201d in the TCR). Not even a single one has been removed, even though some have been frozen for months.\n\nIf all the submitted inverse synths have been accepted and are still listed in the TCR, even if frozen, what is the point of challenging the submission of the few missing ones?\n\n\nThese three points are enough to prove that these submissions should be accepted, once they are we will have all of the SNX inverse synths listed on the TCR. In the meantime I will be waiting for the challenger to submit a counterargument, if there is any."

The first one: \u201cZilliqa(ZIL) was an ERC20 token before its mainnet token launched and so are Aeternity(AE) or Wanchain(WAN). Will we allow tokens in the non-eth chain to be listed here due only to project owners expressing an intention to create an eth-based counterpart or only when that token is live on eth mainnet?\u201d\n\nI don\u2019t see how this point applies to the case in question. All the synths have always been only on eth and there have been no token swaps to other chains. On top of that we also do allow wrapped versions of non-eth tokens to be listed, in our case the tokens are already live on mainnet so I don\u2019t see the point.\n\n\n2. On the topic of contract addresses: \u201cMy stand to reject the listing is also supported by policy line#4 on the importance of checking contract addresses. There were many listing updates in the past for token contracts that were old/deprecated and replaced with a new listing with the new token contract.\u201d\n\nThis doesn\u2019t apply in our case, it would be correct only if we already had a new version of these inverse synths, but we don\u2019t. The synths submitted are the most recent versions of the token, and as such the one that should be listed in the TCR. This point can only be valid if and when a new version of these synths is live.\n\n\n3. The challenger also says \u201cHave you actually tried swapping any of these submitted frozen inverse synths to other synths? I did. And none of your submissions can be swapped, only iBTC- as what the synth monitoring link I sent was about.\u201d\n\nThe challenger is claiming that he tried swapping these inverse synths but was been unable to do so, I find that very hard to believe for a few reasons. First of all only people that already own the asset could have done the swap, as we saw in the previous pieces of evidence. The chances of the challenger having some are low, but if that was the case I am sure that he could point us to his wallet and transaction where he tried to do these swaps?\n\nBut most importantly, if we go by SNX documentation the challenger claim is clearly false, since you can swap the assets back to other synths or sUSD even if frozen, otherwise what would be the point of such an asset that if the price moves too much you are stuck with it forever and unable to redeem it? \n\nSNX is clear on this, and quoting their documentation: \u201cIf it reaches either of its limits and gets frozen, it will no longer be able to be purchased on Synthetix.Exchange, but can still be traded for other Synths at its frozen value.\u201d This leaves no doubts, the asset can still be redeemed for sUSD or swapped to other synths, the only frozen thing is its value and issuance.\n\nOnce again you will find the evidence proving that you can in fact swap your inverse assets even if frozen in the attached document."

This point here is not really clear.\n\n\n2. \u201cIt\u2019s as if saying that adding 2017 dead ICO tokens now to the registry is considered valid - which doesn\u2019t make sense.\u201d\n\nIf we follow the policy and the TCR precedents, there is no doubt that even 2017 dead ICO tokens can be added, since token activity, swap status or use case are not basis for rejection. This is a token registry, the fact that the tokens are not actively traded or inactive does not matter, as the policy explicitly says.\n\n\n3. \u201cThe invalidity of these inverse tokens can also be confirmed here https://www.synthetix-monitoring.com/\u201d\n\nWhat does \u201cinvalidity\u201d mean in this case and what is this page supposed to prove? We already knew the tokens were frozen, as we can see on the page, but as said before this is not considered a basis for rejection in the official policy.\n\n\n4. \u201cApparently you can\u2019t swap it through Uniswap as the submitter claims, because only inverse BTC is the only inverse token that hasn\u2019t \u201creached its limits and gets frozen\u201d.\u201d\n\nThis is once again false, every single ethereum token can be swapped on uniswap if there is liquidity available. \n\nNow there is a very important point that has already been made in the previous piece of evidence that apparently went unnoticed to the challenger: the fact that the token is frozen only means that it\u2019s price will not change on the SNX exchange and that new ones cannot be issued. The frozen tokens that are currently in circulation can still be traded for other synths, redeemed for sUSD or traded on secondary markets.

In this video, eyes colour, shape, iris are not visible.\nAs established by the Proof of Humanity guidelines, in the video \"the face of the submitter should follow the requirements of section 2\", that is, the rules established for the photo to be valid. The guidelines of the photo say \"The picture should include the face of the submitter facing the camera and the facial features must be visible.\" In this case, in Elias Frenkel’s video the eyes features are not visible, he is hindering the visibility of eyes features, which is expressly prohibited by the PoH rules  to prevent the attack of robots or duplicate people. Elias Frenkel never looks at the camera, and neither the pupil nor the iris are seen in the entire video, so if we want the PoH registry to be secure, jurors must vote no.\nThe precedent in case # 577 stated that all facial features, including the eyes, must be visible. The justifications for case # 577 read as follows: \"No. Common sense and practicality indicate that basic facial features such as eyes should be clearly visible, and other presentation requirements related to the visibility of facial features support this notion. . Closed eyes are functionally the same as submitting a photo with eyes covered, which is clearly prohibited by the specified PoH rules. For this reason, the submission must be rejected. I am voting 'No' \"In this case, Elias Frenkel  closes completely the eyes during the all video and therefore some facial characteristics (iris, eye structure, color, etc.) are not visible at all.\nTherefore, as the requirements for the validity of the video are the same as the requirements for the validity of the photo, the jurisprudence established in dispute # 577 must be followed, insofar as it provides that closed eyes are functionally the same as sending a photo with eyes covered. The vote must be \"No\".\nIn adition, in case # 615, where a profile was challenged because she did not open her eyes in the video, two Kleros jurors already voted NO. By the time jurors decide this case, case # 615 is also going to be a precedent to follow. The vote must be \"No\"."

Also, it's wildly unlikely that both parties agreed to this resolution process.\n\nThat said, I *think* (I'm not a lawyer) in most jurisdictions, at least in the US, the landlord *would* be entitled to the deposit. \n\n(1) A security deposit can generally be used for any kind of damages, material or financial.\n\n(2) The tenant committed to the lease via text message, sent the landlord the deposit, and received in consideration the landlord's commitment to give him the lease. This meets the basic elements required for the agreement to be a legally enforceable contract (https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/contract):\n\n- mutual assent, expressed by a valid offer and acceptance: they both agreed to commit to the lease.\n\n- adequate consideration: the tenant provided the security deposit on their side, and the landlord provided commitment to the lease.\n\n- capacity: it seems likely the tenant was capable of taking up the lease, since they rejected it for a fairly frivolous reason.\n\n- legality: Obviously, no one was committing to anything illegal.\n\n(3) The landlord was financially damaged by the tenant's rescission of their agreement, because the landlord lost the opportunity to rent to another interested tenant."

Though, perhaps it is good care to monitor heavy appliances in operation. Would one leave the house with the oven on? Sure one does not need to stand next to the oven and constantly monitor, but perhaps leaving the house would increase risk. Accidents happen, perhaps the paperclip found in the washing machine contributed to malfunction. The landlord does not appear to be negligent. Although the landlord provided the washing machine, does this imply causality? If an adult commits murder, are the parent responsible? No.\n\nIts unfortunate, but I find the tenant responsible."

                "title": "Justification",
                "description": "\"Based on the submitted testimony and evidence, the Tenant should not be held responsible for the damage.\n\nAs part of the lease's terms, a functional (i.e. working without any issue or limitation) washing machine was to be furnished for use by the Tenant.\nThe washing machine provided had been installed and in use - presumably by prior occupants of the apartment - for a period of no less than two to three years. This is assuming the washing machine was brand new at the time it was put in place in 2017 when the building itself was constructed (for all we know it may even be older than that as no further information on the appliance is provided). Based on this, we can assume that the Tenant is in no way responsible for and wear and tear derived from normal usage of the washing machine prior to his leasing the apartment. We can also assume based on these facts that the Tenant also had no way of truly knowing history, true condition, and age of the washing machine prior to leasing the apartment in 2020 - several years into the functioning lifespan of the washing machine itself. \n\nWhile most washing machines have effective lifespans ranging from 5 to 15 years, this can vary tremendously based on the type, brand, frequency of use, and whether or not users place additional stress on the unit (most often from laundry loads exceeding the machine's recommended weight tolerances). This matters in the context of what I stated above where the Tenant in our dispute could not possibly be attributed any responsibility for what the appliance may have been put through before the Tenant leased the apartment and thus assumed responsibility from that point going forward for using the appliance responsibly. While 3 years (possibly more, possibly less) into a washing machine's serviceable lifespan is far from the point of \"\"nearing end of life\"\" status, it is in all likelihood well past the expiration of the original manufacturer's warranty and well into to usage window where regular expected preventative maintenance and minor repairs may need to be done to keep the machine in proper working order to satisfy the terms of the lease requiring a washing machine in proper working order. This line of reasoning should not be considered overly speculative of controversial in the context of this case or the facts presented herein.\n\nNow to the matter of the malfunction of the washing machine itself that caused the damages to the apartment building/units.\n\nThe company that manages the building on behalf of the Landlord conducted their own preliminary investigation and stated - without any further clarification - that the cause of the accident was a malfunctioning washing machine. They did not assign any blame for appliance's malfunction beyond the appliance itself; and certainly did not lay any responsibility for the malfunction at the feet of the Tenant, who was not even specifically mentioned in the report itself. At the conclusion of the report, the building management company did recommend that another (presumably more comprehensive) inspection be conducted on the washing machine, which was subsequently performed by the building's handyman as well as a \"\"technician\"\" hired by the Landlord. It was not explained or submitted into evidence what kind of technician was hired or whether or not he was adequately experienced and qualified in evaluating, repairing, or otherwise working with washing machines.\n\nI will set aside the fact for now that both of the individuals conducting the follow-up inspection were being employed/financially compensated by the Landlord (rather than the Tenant) and thus both have an obvious and demonstrable conflict of interest in how they assess the causal nature of the washing machine malfunction. An analysis that ultimately renders the Tenant blameless and consequently results in the Landlord having to pay the full cost of the repairs could easily lead to punishment from the Landlord in the form of lost future employment opportunities and loss of income. I am not accusing the Landlord, the handyman, or the technician of any dishonesty or malfeasance in this matter, but given the lack of detail provided in the prevailing facts of the case it is definitely a cause for concern. Ideally, the Tenant should have hired his own technician with his own money and had a separate independent inspection of the washing machine conducted to balance out the two inspections conducted by the landlord's two \"\"experts.\"\" While conflicts of interest would still remain on both sides, at least there would have been more useful information to work with in terms of diagnosing how and why the appliance malfunctioned and jurors could fairly and more appropriately evaluate each inspection's credibility. Unfortunately, the Tenant did not do this and it is too late for him to do so. Thus, we must work with what we have.\n\nI said earlier that I will set aside issues of conflicting interests in the additional inspection reports because even after taking that into account, based on the reports provided by the Landlord's own representatives (more specifically the handyman and the technician), the Landlord is unable to prove that the Tenant was the root cause for the washing machine's failure and therefore liable for the building's repair costs (to be paid for out of the bond/security deposit provided by the Tenant at the beginning of the lease).\n\nThe Technician's report stated that soap suds and a paperclip were found in the washer. No further clarification was provided as to the specific nature or origin of the soapsuds (was it laundry detergent? regular soap? something else?). Considering that washing machines, by design, utilize many varieties cleaning agents, the observed presence of \"\"soap suds\"\" without any further contextual information is an ambiguous and unhelpful detail (also know colloquially as a \"\"red herring\"\"). Furthermore, it was stated that the Tenant had been using the washer for several months prior to the incident without any issues and thus presumably knows the proper sort of detergent/cleaning solution to use for washing machines; and it should be noted that the Landlord did not attempt to claim or prove anything to the contrary. Next, anybody who has ever used a washing machine probably already knows that the presence of a single paperclip in a load of laundry is likely not enough to cause a malfunction in the washer's regular operation at all, much less a malfunction on the level of the one that occurred in this scenario. Such an implication on the part of the Landlord's \"\"technician\"\" is borderline preposterous. \n\nThe technician's report stated that the leak could not be replicated. This may be useful later on for diagnostic purposes, but does not prove anything in terms of who or what is responsible for the leak that caused damage to the building. If it can't provide credible insight into the cause of the leak, then it cannot be used as a basis for assigning liability for said leak. \n\nThe Tenant claims that the during the inspections, the technician did not bother to pull out the machine from it's original physical position and manually or visually inspect the pipe/connections where water enters the appliance. The Landlord does not dispute this claim by the Tenant. Considering that this entire issue centers around a water leak, for an appliance technician to fail to thoroughly assess this fundamentally critical area is baffling. Any appliance inspection report insinuating responsibility for an water leak without having actually inspected the parts where the water leak BY DEFINITION must have occurred is worthless and thus its claims can be dismissed as worthless for the purposes of this dispute.\n\nIn conclusion, the Landlord has failed to demonstrate convincingly that the Tenant is in any way sufficiently liable for the the appliance's failure and the resulting water leak. The preponderance of evidence indicates that the Tenant acted reasonably and in a manner that is compliant with the agreed upon terms of the apartment lease concerning use and care of appliances. The Tenant DID NOT act negligibly or in such a way that would render him liable for the resulting damages and thus the Landlord cannot void the Tenant's right to receive back the full amount of his bond/security deposit for the purposes of compensating the Landlord for his building's repair costs.\n\n\""

The Respondent's general compensation is less than this number which seems not to be fair, but in the ballpark of the value of a lost day. The compensation for cabin difference seems fair, as they are not contractually obligated to compensate them at all. \n\nHowever it can be argued that the Respondent should have foreseen these problems if they were in-fact the only remaining cruise tour in operation. Also the days where the Applicant's were not able to do any shore activities should be compensated at a discounted rate. The voucher seems to be the Respondent's way of trying to make amends for this but it is not really a good form of compensation as the Applicants may not want to use this company again after such a bad experience.\n\nThe problem with the Applicant's settlement offer is that they do not provide reasoning for their 70% of the cost figure other than that is what they \"\"feel\"\" like was fair. I think the Respondent is slightly under compensating the Applicant, however contractually they seem to be giving enough value to cover their legal obligations. The Applicant's settlement isn't fair to the Respondent because the Respondent is not solely responsible for their enjoyment of the trip. If the Applicant gave a more nuanced breakdown of the accumulated damages to their enjoyment based on things the Respondent did, and insisted on cash instead of a voucher I would take their side.\n\nHowever as it stands: the Applicant's settlement is purely based on what they feel they are owed which isn't fair to the Respondent and while the Respondent's settlement offer is on the low side, it could be argued as still reasonable. Therefore I will side with the Respondent's offer.\""

Apologies in advance for the long post, but it is necessary for all jurors in the current round to read for context so they can understand why this particular group of cases (536, 537, 538, 539) is so contentious. The Requester\u2019s (pro-removal) side is built upon far better logic and reasoning which is why it is a hill they are apparently willing to die on. For what it\u2019s worth, Cases 537 and 538 have already concluded and have been adjudicated in favor of the Requester\u2019s (pro-removal) side and are no longer being appealed by the Challenger/pro-removal side.\nThe following can be read over in the evidence section of Case 536 (https://court.kleros.io/cases/536) for those who would prefer to break it up into more manageable/readable chunks rather than wade through it all at once here. The content is the same.\nPart 1\nThis first post (of perhaps several) is in response to the Challenger\u2019s most recent comments: I have been following all four Aave token cases (536, 537, 538, and 539) as well as your challenges to the token removal requests from the very beginning. You can wave your money around and arrogantly demean and threaten people all you want, but that does not make your claims any more legitimate or believable. Plenty of jurors and third parties across all four cases have articulated why your position is fundamentally flawed and borderline dishonest and provided much more comprehensive counterarguments than you have to demonstrate support for their side. Rather than address those counter-arguments point by point and refute them (because you can\u2019t), you casually and hubristically ignore them altogether and instead copy/paste the same comments over and over again hoping that enough people here are not engaged enough to notice what you are trying to pull. The \u201cevidences\u201d that you have submitted on your own behalf not only do not sufficiently prove what you are ultimately trying to claim, but upon close examination actually undermine the very claims you are trying to make. Anybody who takes the time and effort to carefully cross-reference and examine all the submitted evidence will see that your entire position relies on poor reasoning, selfishness, and a deliberate disregard for common sense. I will post more refutations to previous comments soon, but in the meantime I encourage all jurors to read the lengthy justification statements previous jurors on the pro-removal side have provided for their votes in Cases 537, 538, and 539. There have been attempts to enter those arguments into the evidence record for prior to voting for everyone to consider but thus far, such efforts have been stymied by the limitations of the Kleros court system interface. In any case, I have copied these arguments (which quite thoroughly destroy the comparatively shallow points made the anti-removal side) and attached them to this comment so that if others are unable to view them in court.kleros.io, they can download the file and read them for themselves. Line by line response to the post \u201cArgument Against Removal (NO)\u201d \"First, a Uniswap user uses the contract address to search for the token to swap\" Arguably false, as anyone who opens up the Uniswap app can see that the search menu states \"Search name or paste address\" Considering that the name (and not the specific contract address) is first and foremost what people will likely use when searching for the token (as it is shorter, easier to remember, and more publicly known hence the reason for having names for contract addresses in the first place), two different addresses with the same name/ticker is both duplicative and confusing. The presumption that Uniswap users automatically \"know\" what to do is a silly and unjustifiable stretch of the imagination. How would an Aave user automatically know which contract address is the one they are supposedly looking for? Where do they find this information if not in the registries and apps (like T2CR) where these tokens are listed? This is akin to expecting users who are not as intimately familiar with these projects as the developers are to be able to either read minds or do burdensome levels of research and verification before utilizing token registries which of course, negates the point of having curated registries in the first place. \"Evidently, previous token will be replaced as soon as presented,\" This statement is directly contradicted by the screenshot of the statements of BigMike and Pablo Candela (already submitted into evidence), which indicates both tokens will be active alongside each other for an indeterminate amount of time. Thus, one is not merely replacing the other outright: there will be TWO tokens listed for people to see. How would having them appear in the lists with identical names/tickers/logos NOT duplicative and therefore potentially confusing for people who don't know which one is which? \"and given the fact that it shares the SAME NAME with the newer version\" As I will explain in further detail below, this is a completely irrelevant consideration. \"what's the point of resubmitting it with 'v1' or 'old' and adding v2 for new ones....when v1 will fade away soon?\" As proven earlier, according to the team behind the tokens v1 will NOT be \"fading away soon.\" The point of resubmitting with different names is to avoid duplicate token listings so that users are not tricked into accidentally buying incorrect or illiquid assets. A possible scenario which is acknowledged by the screenshot of the text conversation between Marc Zeller and Santiago Koki (already submitted into evidence). Avoiding such calamity for users is the entire point of having a \"no duplicates\" rule for the T2CR to begin with. \"WHY REMOVE TO RESUBMIT TO REMOVE\" Because this is the only way to ensure you are following the submission rules of the T2CR while maintaining the existing nomenclature of the tokens given by the token developers. If they had been given different names/logos/tickers to reflect the fact that they are in fact different, this wouldn't even be an issue \"Isn't T2CR more useful without \"unlist\" days of active tokens?\" Useful for whom? Token creators who got themselves in a jam and now don't want to do the extra work required to make sure their tokens meet the submission standards? It's certainly not more useful for the end users of the registry who would be at increased risk for being swindled due to duplicate and confusing token listings. This statement of your shows an alarming and almost reckless disregard for the people who would ostensibly be buying your products. Unlisted tokens can always be relisted, but customers who are scammed due to misleading information cannot get their money back. \"Isn't it more efficient to retain these until the new completely replaced the old?\" Re-read your own submitted evidence and answer me this: are they two completely different valid token assets or is one totally replacing the other and taking its place? Your side has played dumb and claimed both at the same time to try and worm around the fact that each position ultimately fails the requirements for inclusion into the T2CR in its own way. You are trying to argue each angle in a vacuum hoping no one else notices, but I do. Pick one position and stick with it because you can't have it both ways. Response to the post \u201cbulleted arguments and rebuttal attached\u201d You asked the question \u201cLastly, which line in the policy supports the token removal?\u201d: I know you meant for this to be a rhetorical question, but the actual correct answer to the question \u201cwhich line in the policy supports the token removal?\u201d can be found in Bulletpoint #6 the official T2CR policy document where it states \u201cIn the case of duplicates, only the first submission should be accepted.\u201d The two token versions are identical in all relevant aspects other than contract address, thus arguably making them duplicates \u2013 which would then necessitate removal under the policy line stated above. The Challenger also cites previous cases where tokens were rejected due to (allegedly) relatively minor incongruities in the visual format of token logos as a basis for not wanting to create bad precedents based entirely around arguing over increasingly granular technicalities. Aside from the ironic fact that the challenger is essentially employing the same sort of flawed reasoning he is deriding here to advocate for his own position, these cases are irrelevant to the current issue at hand because those cases revolved around token logo compliance in accordance with the specified formatting rules in the T2CR policy (in other words, comparing the submission itself against the policy). This case however is not focused on that \u2013 it is different and much more abstract. Cases 536, 537, 538, and 539 are about comparing a submission against another submission and then subsequently determining whether that comparison sufficiently violates the \u201cno duplicates\u201d policy in the T2CR guidelines. I believe there is no argument to be made that it does not, because the token submitter and those on the anti-removal side have already conceded that the name, logo, and ticker ARE duplicative of an earlier submission (the version 1 token), but that it really shouldn\u2019t matter because if you examine closely enough, one can see that the contract addresses are in fact different. In summary, the previous rulings in cases do not apply here since they were in essence about completely different issues. Furthermore, the main argument of original submitter of the version 2 tokens, as well as those in the anti-removal camp, is just a thinly veiled attempt at sympathy rather than an argument that is based on anything substantive. Reading between the lines and paraphrasing, I am seeing a lot of this on the part of the anti-removal side: \u201cWe\u2019re just following the rules as they\u2019re written! The proper and commonly used names happen to be the same!\u201d \u201cThe guidelines state no duplicates, but we can\u2019t help that our version 1 and version 2 tokens (by admission two completely different tokens with unique addresses) are identical in every other aspect! Yes, it is potentially confusing, and we admit that, but if you made us follow the rules like everybody else our token wouldn\u2019t be eligible! It\u2019s not fair to us! We might even have to remove and re-submit our old tokens! Think of all the extra work might have to do to make sure consumers aren\u2019t hoodwinked!\u201d Spare me. Never mind the fact that their own conversations (submitted by their own side as evidence) contradict the notion that they have no idea why there would be now be controversy over the name and appearance of both token versions as they are currently labeled. As stated earlier, they are instead pretending to be oblivious and/or innocently dumb about what the dispute is inherently about and choosing to blame the challengers and the authors of the T2CR guidelines for what is in reality the token submitter\u2019s own failure to do their due diligence and properly differentiate their obviously different tokens in accordance with the T2CR policies. Policies I might add were published in the public domain well beforehand and thus any claim to ignorance on the matter defies credulity. One could make the argument that the T2CR guidelines should be revised and clarified in the aftermath of this case so submitters have better idea of what constitutes a duplicate submission, but to argue that the submitters of the token are being held to an retroactively arbitrary and unfair interpretation of the \u201cno duplicates\u201d policy is quite frankly a bit insulting to everyone else\u2019s intelligence; and taking such a claim at face value requires one to suspend disbelief and assume that Marc Zeller and his associates did not in fact believe what they were telling other people about the ongoing plans for both token versions at the time they were saying it. (These conversations have been submitted into evidence for cases 536, 537, 538, and 539 and can be viewed by everybody participating in the case. I encourage everyone here to do so and see the contradictions for themselves). It is not the fault of the T2CR policies, nor is it the fault of those on the pro-removal side that the developers/submitters foolishly chose identical common-use names, tickers, and logos for both token versions when 1) they knew they were not the same tokens, as evidenced by the unique contract addresses 2) would be used concurrently and never at any point be the same until the version 1 was eventually phased out and 3) would in fact necessitate further differentiation in name/logo/ticker in due time - which is largely what they pro-removal side in all of these cases is using as a (quite reasonable) basis for arguing why the two tokens/versions should appear differently in the registry to begin with. Phrased another way: it is not necessarily a failure of the T2CR guidelines that in order to comply properly with the \u201cno duplicates\u201d policy as it is written, the Version 2 token would have had to have been submitted with the commonly used name/logo/ticker which also happens to be the commonly used name/logo/ticker of another (and apparently entirely separate) token that was previously submitted and accepted. This is underlying basis for the sympathy angle the token submitters and anti-removal party is angling for (as if to imply that the submitter\u2019s hands were unfortunately tied in the matter), but it doesn\u2019t stand up to basic scrutiny. While on its surface, this may seem like an unfair catch-22 situation for the token submitters, in actuality it is not and such an argument on the part of the anti-removal party is (in my opinion) entirely disingenuous. I will explain further: The \u201cno duplicates\u201d policy has a clear intention and while perhaps not exhaustively specific, it is nevertheless clear enough that anyone with common sense and basic reading comprehension can understand it and tailor their token submissions accordingly to comply. If your tokens are, by your own design and implementation, going to be in violation of the stated T2CR policy from the very beginning; then simply put that is YOUR problem not the T2CR\u2019s. No one is forcing you to submit your tokens, no one is changing the rules/standards after the fact, and no one is preventing your from asking pertinent questions of the Kleros T2CR team and getting confirmation of the policy\u2019s nuances before you spend the time and money submitting them for evaluation. You may not like it. It may have been an honest mistake or oversight. You may think it is unfair. You may even think it highlights an obvious ambiguity in the T2CR guidelines that needs to be addressed (I for one agree that it does), but the bottom line is this entire clown show could have been avoided if those behind the original token submission planned their own projects and implementation schedules better. Now, instead of owning up to their error and re-doing things properly, they are hoping to convince enough people here to twist their own understanding of the definition of the word \u201cduplicate\u201d so that they may not only escape the negative consequences of their poor decision-making, but actually profit from it \u2013 regardless of the obvious negative effects this could have on the quality of the T2CR registry and the consumers who rely on it for accurate information. A sane and rational person would vote for removal of the token, as a vote to allow the token would forever enshrine the right of token creators going forward to recklessly create and submit tokens with haphazard, confusing, and even borderline deceptive nomenclature while still being in compliance with the T2CR policies. The result would mean more unnecessary risk and uncertainty being taken on by the end users who essentially will no longer be able to rely on the T2CR to vouch for the legitimacy of tokens (or information regarding the tokens) since users would be forced to consult multiple other sources to be reasonably sure of what they are seeing/buying. A vote to allow the token to remain constitutes a clear lack of enforcement on this matter and would signal to the entire community the T2CR guidelines and submission standards are a joke and are not intended to be taken seriously. Anything other than a vote to remove the tokens in question would ultimately cripple the T2CR\u2019s legitimacy and usefulness as a registry. The risks to the people who use the registry in good faith far outweighs the immediate economic considerations of the token creators/submitters, who are in this entirely avoidable situation largely due to their own poor choices and lack of forward thinking. A vote to remove the token is only a temporary inconvenience to them and does not in any way prevent them from making the proper adjustments to their tokens and resubmitting them for future inclusion to the registry. A vote for inclusion, however, forever hurts the people/community that uses the T2CR and who have an enormous stake in the outcome of this case despite bearing no responsibility for the sequence of events that led us here.\nPart 2\nBelow is a copy of the justification a juror provided for his vote to remove the token in Case 538 - which definitely applies in this case as they are fundamentally identical situations. \"I sincerely hope the Kleros team is paying attention and sees this because I believe the crux of the matter being disputed in this case is largely derived from a glaring ambiguity in the official T2CR Token Curated List Policies. This is also an example of previous case law being unhelpful for providing a firm precedent or even basic guidance as similar cases have feature coherent rulings that are inherently contradictory. The T2CR policies state that no 'duplicates' are to be accepted and yet it does not go on to explain in detail the following criteria which may be helpful in ascertaining whether a token submission qualifies: Does the term 'duplicate', in essence, refer to a separate repeat instance of the same token being submitted? (obviously such an example would qualify under the term). Or does the definition of 'duplicate' also include different tokens that share 'duplicate' (i.e. identical) names/tickers/logos/etc.? Under the former definition, one could argue that the submission should not be removed as it is obviously a distinct token (version) with a unique contract address. Under the latter definition however, it could easily be argued that due to sharing the same ticker name and logo that for the purposes of being listed in the database that it is a duplicate and that this violates the spirit of the \"no duplicates\" policy in the document outlining the T2CR rules. There is also no clarification as to which set of criteria (contract address vs. naming conventions/logo) is to take precedence in determining whether a submission is a duplicate in the event that a token meets one set of criteria, but fails to meet another, as is clearly the situation here. Frankly, the fact that the original submitter behind both the Aave v1 and v2 tokens opted to use the same naming conventions and logo between what were obviously two different tokens irks me because this whole dispute could have been avoided by simply not reusing the same nomenclature for both versions. Given that part of the submitted evidence on behalf of are statements from Marc Zeller indicating that 1) the two tokens/versions are intended to be distinct from each other and 2) in the near future, updated naming conventions for each version of the token clarifying this clear distinction are not only to be expected, but actually are likely to be a necessity. Taking this statement at face value it would seem that the original submitter of the v1 and v2 Aave ENJ token is obviously aware of the possible confusion that could be caused by having two separate tokens (with different contract addresses) share the same ticker, logo, and name, but simply doesn't care because he is relying on a very narrow interpretation of the T2CR requirements to argue that because they are not actually duplicate tokens in practice, every other piece of required information describing the two tokens may be duplicative between the two. If this were the case, then why bother having strict requirements for the names, logos, and tickers of submitted tokens to begin with? Per his own words, the submitter is aware of the inherently duplicative nature of the aforementioned details, and yet is pretending to play dumb and not understanding the obvious potential for confusion by focusing exclusively on the fact that at the moment the contract addresses (and only the addresses mind you) between the two tokens are different as sufficient proof they are not duplicates as far as the T2CR is concerned; all while conveniently pretending as if the other variables simply don't exist or don't matter. If a unique contract address was the only piece of identifying information required for determining whether a submission is a duplicate, then surely the T2CR policies would have said so in more specificity would they not? Considering that no such language exists in the T2CR Guidelines, one should not assume that there is a reasonable basis for interpreting the requirements in such a manner. By the same logic, we can also infer that since token name, ticker, and logo are specifically referenced in the context of submission requirements and since past cases have used these factors to judge whether token submissions are duplicative, we cannot simply disregard them now even if a particular novel reading of the established rules makes a plausible argument that they don't matter and never did matter as far as the true definition of \"duplicate\" is concerned. Furthermore, however flawed or incomplete the T2CR's language may be when examined with stricter scrutiny, the overall \"spirit of the law\" in having such submission requirements in the first place (to prevent duplicates), is to ultimately serve the end user's and/or community's best interests by ensuring minimal confusion and accuracy of information regarding the tokens are that are ultimately allowed into the registry. Reinterpreting the guidelines in such a way that grants token submitters excessive leeway to submit different tokens with otherwise identical nomenclature and visual appearance (especially when doing so could easily cause confusion and avoidable user errors) arguably inverts the original objective of the T2CR policy so that it is primarily serving token creators first and consumers/the wider public a distant second. The T2CR does not -and should not - operate primarily to benefit token submitters at the inevitable detriment of end users. Especially when the entire issue could have been mitigated by the token submitter/developer themselves if they had simply taken the time and effort to properly differentiate between their multiple tokens at the beforehand and given them unique indentifying qualities before trying to submit them to the registry. The fact of the matter is that the token creators painted themselves into a corner by reusing the same name, ticker, and logo for both versions. And, rather than go back and properly differentiate them before proper resubmission, they opted to submit what they had \"as-is\" and try their luck anyway by claiming that the obviously duplicative aspects between tokens are not actually duplicative (and thus not disqualifying) because those aspects don't really matter anyway. Such reasoning on the part of the submitter (and by extension the challenger arguing on their behalf): 1) clearly runs contrary to the logic implied by the language in the T2CR submission rules, as well as spirit of the rules themselves 2) requires a significant and unjustifiable reinterpretation of the submission rules as they are commonly understood 3) disregards prior case rulings that have upheld using the all aforementioned criteria for determining whether or not a submission is a \"duplicate\" For these reasons, I am thus obligated to vote \"Yes, Remove the token from the registry\" \"\nPart 3 (regarding previous voting rounds/results for Case 539)\nFor some reason I cannot attach documents to my posts so I am forced to copy the entirety of the text into the Description box. My apologies for the lengthiness as well as the lack of formatting, but I strongly feel it is necessary for everyone to read. This is my last evidence submission below (for now). Earlier in the case the challenger/anti-removal side claimed that Case 539 - due to being similar in terms of the issues at hand - provided guidance for jurors to vote in this case because there was overwhelming \"consensus\" due to the eventual vote totals. The following analysis will thoroughly dismantle this claim of theirs as little more than a red herring that is irrelevant to the strength of either side and not at all predicative of which side will prevail in later voting rounds: More evidence for Case 539 (post-appeal) As stated earlier by multiple parties and observers, Case 539 is not only similar to Cases 536, 537, 538, but they are all identical regarding the particular issue being debated. There is no divergence and the same arguments proving the validity of the pro-removal side equally apply for in all four cases. It has been argued here and elsewhere that Case 539 is different because there has been \u201cconsensus\u201d reached by jurors in the previous rounds of voting that the challenge to the removal quest is the correct verdict, but a quick analysis of the vote record easily disproves this and highlights why an appeal to the previous rulings in favor of the challenger is in fact the incorrect one. Simply put, the \u201cconsensus\u201d decisions by jurors in previous rounds is due almost entirely to lucky juror selection and vote weighing \u2013 perfectly valid under the rules of Kleros, but statistically anomalous and not indicative of a truly objective sample of independent jurors. All of the following information can easily be viewed by anyone here in the KlerosBoard Dispute Scanner and I encourage everyone to check and see for yourselves: (For the sake of brevity, I\u2019m abbreviating the referenced juror ID\u2019s to the last several digits/letters) For example, in Round 0 there were three juror \u2018votes\u2019, but only two different jurors: \u20185E47\u2019 and \u2018F66c13\u2019. Due to court stake weighing, F66c13 got to vote twice in the same round while 5E47 got one vote. 5E47 voted \u201cYes\u201d to the removal request while F66c13 voted \u2018no\u2019 and since he got to vote \u2018no\u2019 twice 5E47 and the \u2018yes\u2019 side lost the round two votes to one. In a normal jury this would result in a deadlock or more likely, the tiebreaking third juror vote would belong to an independent third individual, but this was not the case here. It gets worse. In the next round (Round 1), F66c13 got picked again while 5E47 did not. Once again, F66c13 got to re-cast his \u201cno\u201d vote in an appeal round that was essentially contesting the fairness of the outcome of the previous round, which was entirely decided by him and him alone. Now those claiming \u201cconsensus\u201d will cite this round for proof arguing that all the other jurors voted unanimously with F66c13 and that fact should put the matter to rest. As we will see it is not that simple. Likely figuring that the true margin between yes/no votes when taking into account a larger sample size of the jury pool is probably much closer than the second round would indicate (as proven by the first round, the Requester appeals again and opts for a larger 15-vote jury pool in the next round. But once again, court stake weighting ends up burning him a third time. In the next round (Round 2 as labeled in the Kleros Dispute Scanner), four of the seven jurors from the previous round are also picked again to re-cast the same vote on the same case: F6613 (now his third consecutive time voting), 470a, EEB2Ca, and D2364. Furthermore, whereas the previous round had all seven jurors one cast one \u2018vote\u2019 each, in Round 3 the randomized weighing skews the voting even worse: F66c13 (who had two votes in Round 0 and had one vote in Round 1) now has three votes in Round 2. EEB2Ca (who did not vote in Round 0 and had one vote in Round 1) now has two votes in Round 2. D2364 (who did not vote in Round 0 and had one vote in Round 1) now has two votes in Round 2. 470a (who did not vote in Round 0 and had one vote in Round 1), once again has one vote in Round 2. Predictably, these four jurors cast the same vote (\u2018no\u2019) as they did in the previous rounds. Assuming they are rational and would obviously never vote against themselves and lose staked PNK, anyone can predict with a reasonable degree of certainty beforehand how they are going to vote so they are incentivized to vote the same way as before. Altogether these four jurors controlled eight of the fifteen jury votes allocated for Round 2. By themselves, these four jurors constituted the majority of the votes for the latest appeal round and thus (much like in Round 0), the outcome was a foregone conclusion: Arguably, drawing other jurors for the latest appeal round wasn\u2019t even necessary from a decision standpoint as the outcome was never in going to be in doubt. Even if every remaining (first time voting on this case) juror picked specifically for Round 2 unanimously voted the opposite way, it simply wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway because from the outset it was mathematically impossible for the Requester to win given the same jurors were basically being asked to review their own verdict. Given the economic incentives in place for these jurors to uphold their previous ruling, this represents an obvious conflict of interest in the Kleros appeals process. While no one is arguing that this unfortunate anomaly is against the rules or intentional, it certainly is cosmically unfair and arguably defeats the original purpose of having an appeals process \u2013 which is to ensure that appellants can have a new set of jurors (i.e. a fresh set of eyes/ears/perspectives) re-examine the facts of the case and either overturn an unfair verdict or return the original verdict with a higher degree of confidence and consensus. Any juror in the current appeal round who might be lending credence to the fallacious argument that jurors should consider that all previous votes went in favor of the challenger should review this publicly-available information and consider for themselves the following: 1) Are the results of the previous voting rounds necessarily indicative of a proper jury (i.e. one vote per unique juror) would vote if they had the opportunity? 2) Given the obvious skews in voter weights and subsequent conflicts of interest, are the results of the previous voting rounds indicative of how a new set of jurors (hopefully more balanced) would vote given the same presented evidence/arguments? 3) Are you willing to risk your PNK/stake betting that this pool of jurors that you currently sit in will be as biased and as poorly sampled as the previous three in a row? All I am asking of jurors in this latest round is for them to simply base his/her vote on the facts of the case and arguments presented herein and only those facts/arguments. For those who may be nervous and tempted to vote to uphold previous rulings based on the false appearance of consensus, it would be wise to disregard those results since they are indicative of absolutely nothing other than statistical noise \u2013 certainly not of the strength of the individual case arguments and certainly not how another jury is likely to vote afterward. Any claim to the contrary is a fallacious attempt on their part to bluff/scare you into voting a certain way rather than articulating an actual defense of their position based on the facts of the case.\nPart 4 (follow up rebuttal to Challenger\u2019s latest comment titled \u201cHere\u201d posted 20 Jan 2021 08:22:10 GMT)\nI will take the challenger's obvious deflection and passive-aggressive sarcasm as a sign he is conceding the overall argument\n\nAll those words and yet you really had nothing else to say. By all means feel free to refute my arguments if you can: I'm happy to debate any of the points I raised. I don't take such things personally. Since you bothered to post all that, I will at least do you the courtesy of answering each statement of yours seriously even though I suspect that was hardly your intention. First of all, if you are going to forgo the use of logical discourse and instead rely on smarmy retorts to sway onlookers towards your side, then at the very least make sure your comment isn\u2019t composed primarily of run-on sentences and borderline indecipherable syntax. Brevity is the soul of wit after all. \u201cAbove contention implies or more so demeans Aave\u2019s lack of vision to make a unique distinction to its token\u2026\u201d I did not imply it \u2013 I outright said it because it\u2019s the truth, and I will unapologetically say it again once more for the record: Aave got cocky and/or sloppy, didn\u2019t do their due diligence, and are now finding themselves \u201choisted by their own petard\u201d as the old saying goes. \u201cthat discreetly leads users to its detriment\u2026\u201d An inevitable consequence for the T2CR userbase if the Aave/anti-removal side has their way. Intentional or not this is what you are asking for. Either address the point and demonstrate how such an outcome is not detrimental or quit dismissing the concerns that have been raised. \u201cKleros T2CR team for not creating an all-encompassing policy\u201d I mentioned the Kleros team because their policy as written is inherently susceptible to abuse by submitters like Aave as there is an (albeit frivolous) opening for litigants to use the ambiguity in the current language to weasel their way around meeting the T2CR submission requirements. Rather than endlessly litigating situations like this, I simply suggested the Kleros team might find it useful to update and clarify the language in the T2CR guidelines so that there is a more defined set of criteria for everyone to use for assessing whether a submission is a duplicate. A more clearly defined policy from the outset would have been to everyone\u2019s benefit here, would it not? In any case, what the Kleros team decides to do with the T2CR going forward changes nothing as far as this case is concerned. In other words, you are still wrong. \u201cincluding but not limited to cultural interpretation, language barrier and evolution, imagination, social injustice\u2026\u201d Even in context the rest of your statement makes little to no sense, but I will try my best with it anyway. It sounds like you are not only misrepresenting what I said but also adding claims I never made in the first place. Hardly fair to me, but then again you don\u2019t even do a very good job of knocking down the strawman you created so it\u2019s difficult for me to really get upset about it. Cultural Interpretation? Are you from a different culture? If you are claiming ignorance on these grounds well, that sounds like that would have been a great thing to double-check before submitting. Otherwise this is irrelevant. Language barrier? Do you not speak English? Gee that sounds like it would have been a great thing to double-check before submitting. Imagination? Of all the non sequiturs you could have desperately pulled out of thin air, this one might be the least helpful to bolstering your argument. It doesn\u2019t take much imagination to envision the original intent of the T2CR \u201cno duplicates\u201d rule and it takes even less imagination to see how different tokens with identical names, logos, and tickers would cause problems for unaware users. Social Injustice? If you are still failing to understand the ethical considerations of the position you are advocating for then there is not much else I can do. I mean\u2026I can explain it to you, but I can\u2019t understand it for you. \u201dAND its court results based purely on luck and anomalous statistical selection thereby treating NO jurors without capabilities to think for themselves.\u201d I brought up the juror selection anomalies in Case 539 because as I expected, when your side ran out of actual arguments to employ you then tried to cite the voting results in Case 539 as evidence that your side has already been judged by multiple rounds of jurors to be \u201cright\u201d and anyone looking for guidance on how others would vote could rely on that so as not to vote incoherently. All I did was demonstrate that claim was utter BS. I don\u2019t see how you can accuse me of treating jurors like mindless sheep when I am the one that implored them to consider the facts \u2013 not the merely previous votes by fellow jurors - and think for themselves. Your side however tried to induce them into voting a certain way by implying that they would be risking their staked PNK if they voted contrary to previous rounds. Arguably, the only person here who is guilty of disregarding the individual agency of the jurors is you (or whoever it was on your side that cited Case 539). \u201cYou are a highborn of supreme intelligence\u201d Your words not mine (not that I would ever describe myself in such a way). All in all, a rather petty way to round out your closing arguments if you ask me, but I am not the manners police so feel free to express yourself. \u201cthat can interpret policies beneath and beyond their plain meaning\u201d This is more or less what your side (the anti-removal side that is) was hinging their entire strategy on across all four cases. The pro-removal side was demanding a narrower and less tortured reading of the rule in question. More projection on your part. \u201cI am but a simple man\u2026\u201d I will take you at your word on that. \u201cthat follows and respects policies.\u201d Debatable."

The other group believes this should be removed to benefit the quality of the T2CR and protect (third party) users of the list from confusion and potential financial loss.\n\nThis has caused an opportunity for people to clash in highly polarized cases. The contra-removal group insists that the policy should be updated to include a specific procedure for how we should handle these \u2013 and doesn\u2019t budge until it happens \u2013 actually lowering the quality of Kleros products and the usability of the list.\n\nThe pro-removal group believes this action is perfectly valid and in good faith. They claim there is currently no way to upgrade a token to its new form without removing the previous one. (Simply uploading the second version first would cause a duplicate in name + ticker to exist in the T2CR \u2013 clashing with policy).\n\nI believe there is no reason to challenge the removal of the v1 aTokens, since the list would benefit from a proper upgrade to v2. The old tokens can, but should not be reuploaded with an [OLD] or \u201cv1\u201d addition. I say \u2018can but shouldn\u2019t\" because Marc Zeller of Aave has confirmed in Telegram that the v1 tokens will become frozen and fade away soon => Only official tokens are the V2 now (see Evidence)\n\nIf you are a juror who cares about the quality of Kleros and wants to win the last round of this case, I believe you should vote \u201cYes, remove\u201d. Only the outcome of the last round matters, and you will receive all locked tokens from incoherent jurors.\n\nInvolved policies for voting YES:\n\u27a4 Contract addresses are an attack vector and should be checked carefully. (> danger for users trading wrong asset)\n\n\u27a4 In case of duplicates, only the first submission should be accepted. The most recent submissions appear highest in the list. (>no way to upload duplicate names without removing v1)\n\n\u27a4Requests are not to be denied listing based on token creation date, token swap status (with non-ethereum chains), use case or token activity (> Listing can be denied for token swaps on Ethereum)"

That way, Aave YFI (v1) and Aave YFI (v2) will be indistuinguishable for users of the Kleros tokenlist. The only difference would then be the contract address, which would be very confusing for T2CR users. There needs to be a difference between the data of old and new/migrated tokens, so at least one of the following:\n1. Different name;\n2. Different ticker;\n3. Different logo. \n\nIn the T2CR, there are 0 instances of submissions with the same name, ticker, and logo. Couple of months ago, when all the removals of migrated tokens got challenged, note that only those were challenged, where there was a difference in name, ticker, or logo. That is because having two submissions in the T2CR with the same name, ticker, and logo, will be confusing for T2CR users, but also for Kleros tokenlist users. \n\nA difference in either the name, ticker, or logo can be seen at for instance the following tokens: \n1. Augur: Ticker (REP and REPv2);\n2. Aeron: Ticker (ARN and ARNX);\n3. Autonio Ticker (NIO and NIOX);\n4. UniCrypt: Logo;\n5. Eidoo: Name and Ticker (EDO and PNT);\n\n(note that some old tokens still got removed from the T2CR, for instance REP, but that reason was because of incorrect centering of the logo, so unrelated to this case).\n\nIn conclusion, we should NOT allow duplicates (same name, ticker, and logo) into the T2CR. In order to update the T2CR, we need to submit the new Aave tokens, as the old ones will be used less and less, and the new ones more and more. Someday soon the v1 tokens will be depreciated, and the v2 will be the only active Aave token. I am not saying we can't have the v1 tokens in the T2CR, they just ought to have a different name, ticker, or logo, from the new v2 tokens. We can debate about the correct naming convention we should follow in the juror chit-chat on Telegram. We need to re-submit all the v1 tokens to the T2CR, but with a different name. I would vouch for using v1 behind the name, I think that's more slick than (OLD), which aggregators seem to prefer. What is certain, however, is that the last 4 remaining Aave v1 tokens need to be removed from the T2CR, so that we can start adding the v2 tokens to the T2CR, using the correct name.\n\nLastly, I want to react to the following fallacy: \nChallenger: \"If not for one address that was drawn twice, results would have been different.\" \nMe: \"All the Spanish guys are acting like a mob. If there is something which had an influence on all these cases, it's the fact that the Spanish community is all voting the same way, in a group.\""

He is just trying to find something to challenge me on, although I would understand if he would have challenged for duplicates. Because, we shouldn't want to have duplicates (same name, ticker, and logo) in the T2CR, as that would only cause confusion among users of the Kleros tokenlist. There needs to be a distinction between the old v1 - depreciating - tokens and the new - staying - v2 tokens. As the v2 tokens will remain, they need to use the correct names, so Aave ENJ in this case. \n\nThe challenger is lying about the reason for the rejections of Marc's submissions, which was not, as the challenger is incorrectly saying, only because of the logo quality. All his submissions were also challenged for being duplicates, you can see that in the cases yourself.\n\nLets keep the T2CR a usefull list of curated tokens, which users can use to trade on Uniswap, and for more. We can't allow duplicates in this list, which is also against the policy of course. Just like all the other Aave v1 tokens which were already removed, these last 4 need to be removed as well, in order to be able to add the v2 tokens to the T2CR. Lets not make this too much of a hassle, as it's certainly necessary to remove these last 4 tokens.\n\nPS. CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap are simply not up to date, as they still have the old tokens listed only. They are no valid source in this case, as they are outdated. As can be seen with other projects, they usually list the new tokens, and use (old) behind the names of the old tokens.

I would vouch for using v1 behind the name, I think that's more slick than (OLD), which aggregators seem to prefer. What is certain, however, is that the last 4 remaining Aave v1 tokens need to be removed from the T2CR, so that we can start adding the v2 tokens to the T2CR, using the correct name.\n\nLastly, I want to react to the following fallacy: \nChallenger: \"If not for one address that was drawn twice, results would have been different.\" \nMe: \"All the Spanish guys are acting like a mob. If there is something which had an influence on all these cases, it's the fact that the Spanish community is all voting the same way, in a group.\""

He is just trying to find something to challenge me on, although I would understand if he would have challenged for duplicates. Because, we shouldn't want to have duplicates (same name, ticker, and logo) in the T2CR, as that would only cause confusion among users of the Kleros tokenlist. There needs to be a distinction between the old v1 - depreciating - tokens and the new - staying - v2 tokens.

We can't allow duplicates in this list, which is also against the policy of course.

CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap are simply not up to date, as they still have the old tokens listed only. They are no valid source in this case, as they are outdated. As can be seen with other projects, they usually list the new tokens, and use (old) behind the names of the old tokens. In the case of Aave, I would suggest to use \"v1\" behind the names when re-submitting them to the T2CR."

Either address the point and demonstrate how such an outcome is not detrimental or quit dismissing the concerns that have been raised. \n\u201cKleros T2CR team for not creating an all-encompassing policy\u201d\nI mentioned the Kleros team because their policy as written is inherently susceptible to abuse by submitters like Aave as there is an (albeit frivolous) opening for litigants to use the ambiguity in the current language to weasel their way around meeting the T2CR submission requirements. Rather than endlessly litigating situations like this, I simply suggested the Kleros team might find it useful to update and clarify the language in the T2CR guidelines so that there is a more defined set of criteria for everyone to use for assessing whether a submission is a duplicate. \nA more clearly defined policy from the outset would have been to everyone\u2019s benefit here, would it not?\nIn any case, what the Kleros team decides to do with the T2CR going forward changes nothing as far as this case is concerned. In other words, you are still wrong.\n\u201cincluding but not limited to cultural interpretation, language barrier and evolution, imagination, social injustice\u2026\u201d\nEven in context the rest of your statement makes little to no sense, but I will try my best with it anyway.\nIt sounds like you are not only misrepresenting what I said but also adding claims I never made in the first place. Hardly fair to me, but then again you don\u2019t even do a very good job of knocking down the strawman you created so it\u2019s difficult for me to really get upset about it.\nCultural Interpretation? Are you from a different culture? If you are claiming ignorance on these grounds well, that sounds like that would have been a great thing to double-check before submitting. Otherwise this is irrelevant.\nLanguage barrier? Do you not speak English? Gee that sounds like it would have been a great thing to double-check before submitting.\nImagination? Of all the non sequiturs you could have desperately pulled out of thin air, this one might be the least helpful to bolstering your argument. It doesn\u2019t take much imagination to envision the original intent of the T2CR \u201cno duplicates\u201d rule and it takes even less imagination to see how different tokens with identical names, logos, and tickers would cause problems for unaware users. \nSocial Injustice? If you are still failing to understand the ethical considerations of the position you are advocating for then there is not much else I can do.

All I did was demonstrate that claim was utter BS. I don\u2019t see how you can accuse me of treating jurors like mindless sheep when I am the one that implored them to consider the facts \u2013 not the merely previous votes by fellow jurors -  and think for themselves. Your side however tried to induce them into voting a certain way by implying that they would be risking their staked PNK if they voted contrary to previous rounds.

My apologies for the lengthiness as well as the lack of formatting, but I strongly feel it is necessary for everyone to read.\n\nThis is my last evidence submission below (for now). Earlier in the case the challenger/anti-removal side claimed that Case 539 - due to being similar in terms of the issues at hand - provided guidance for jurors to vote in this case because there was overwhelming \"consensus\" due to the eventual vote totals. The following analysis will thoroughly dismantle this claim of theirs as little more than a red herring that is irrelevant to the strength of either side and not at all predicative of which side will prevail in later voting rounds:\n\nMore evidence for Case 539 (post-appeal)\nAs stated earlier by multiple parties and observers, Case 539 is not only similar to Cases 536, 537, 538, but they are all identical regarding the particular issue being debated. There is no divergence and the same arguments proving the validity of the pro-removal side equally apply for in all four cases.\nIt has been argued here and elsewhere that Case 539 is different because there has been \u201cconsensus\u201d reached by jurors in the previous rounds of voting that the challenge to the removal quest is the correct verdict, but a quick analysis of the vote record easily disproves this and highlights why an appeal to the previous rulings in favor of the challenger is in fact the incorrect one.\nSimply put, the \u201cconsensus\u201d decisions by jurors in previous rounds is due almost entirely to lucky juror selection and vote weighing \u2013 perfectly valid under the rules of Kleros, but statistically anomalous and not indicative of a truly objective sample of independent jurors. All of the following information can easily be viewed by anyone here in the KlerosBoard Dispute Scanner and I encourage everyone to check and see for yourselves:\n(For the sake of brevity, I\u2019m abbreviating the referenced juror ID\u2019s to the last several digits/letters)\nFor example, in Round 0 there were three juror \u2018votes\u2019, but only two different jurors: \u20185E47\u2019 and \u2018F66c13\u2019. Due to court stake weighing, F66c13 got to vote twice in the same round while 5E47 got one vote. 5E47 voted \u201cYes\u201d to the removal request while F66c13 voted \u2018no\u2019 and since he got to vote \u2018no\u2019 twice 5E47 and the \u2018yes\u2019 side lost the round two votes to one. In a normal jury this would result in a deadlock or more likely, the tiebreaking third juror vote would belong to an independent third individual, but this was not the case here. It gets worse.\nIn the next round (Round 1), F66c13 got picked again while 5E47 did not. Once again, F66c13 got to re-cast his \u201cno\u201d vote in an appeal round that was essentially contesting the fairness of the outcome of the previous round, which was entirely decided by him and him alone. \nNow those claiming \u201cconsensus\u201d will cite this round for proof arguing that all the other jurors voted unanimously with F66c13 and that fact should put the matter to rest. As we will see it is not that simple. Likely figuring that the true margin between yes/no votes when taking into account a larger sample size of the jury pool is probably much closer than the second round would indicate (as proven by the first round, the Requester appeals again and opts for a larger 15-vote jury pool in the next round. But once again, court stake weighting ends up burning him a third time.\nIn the next round (Round 2 as labeled in the Kleros Dispute Scanner), four of the seven jurors from the previous round are also picked again to re-cast the same vote on the same case: F6613 (now his third consecutive time voting), 470a, EEB2Ca, and D2364. Furthermore, whereas the previous round had all seven jurors one cast one \u2018vote\u2019 each, in Round 3 the randomized weighing skews the voting even worse:\nF66c13 (who had two votes in Round 0 and had one vote in Round 1) now has three votes in Round 2.\nEEB2Ca (who did not vote in Round 0 and had one vote in Round 1) now has two votes in Round 2.\nD2364 (who did not vote in Round 0 and had one vote in Round 1) now has two votes in Round 2.\n470a (who did not vote in Round 0 and had one vote in Round 1), once again has one vote in Round 2.\nPredictably, these four jurors cast the same vote (\u2018no\u2019) as they did in the previous rounds. Assuming they are rational and would obviously never vote against themselves and lose staked PNK, anyone can predict with a reasonable degree of certainty beforehand how they are going to vote so they are incentivized to vote the same way as before. Altogether these four jurors controlled eight of the fifteen jury votes allocated for Round 2. By themselves, these four jurors constituted the majority of the votes for the latest appeal round and thus (much like in Round 0), the outcome was a foregone conclusion: Arguably, drawing other jurors for the latest appeal round wasn\u2019t even necessary from a decision standpoint as the outcome was never in going to be in doubt. Even if every remaining (first time voting on this case) juror picked specifically for Round 2 unanimously voted the opposite way, it simply wouldn\u2019t have mattered anyway because from the outset it was mathematically impossible for the Requester to win given the same jurors were basically being asked to review their own verdict. Given the economic incentives in place for these jurors to uphold their previous ruling, this represents an obvious conflict of interest in the Kleros appeals process.\nWhile no one is arguing that this unfortunate anomaly is against the rules or intentional, it certainly is cosmically unfair and arguably defeats the original purpose of having an appeals process \u2013 which is to ensure that appellants can have a new set of jurors (i.e. a fresh set of eyes/ears/perspectives) re-examine the facts of the case and either overturn an unfair verdict or return the original verdict with a higher degree of confidence and consensus.\nAny juror in the current appeal round who might be lending credence to the fallacious argument that jurors should consider that all previous votes went in favor of the challenger should review this publicly-available information and consider for themselves the following:\n1) Are the results of the previous voting rounds necessarily indicative of a proper jury (i.e. one vote per unique juror) would vote if they had the opportunity? \n2) Given the obvious skews in voter weights and subsequent conflicts of interest, are the results of the previous voting rounds indicative of how a new set of jurors (hopefully more balanced) would vote given the same presented evidence/arguments?\n3) Are you willing to risk your PNK/stake betting that this pool of jurors that you currently sit in will be as biased and as poorly sampled as the previous three in a row?  \nAll I am asking of jurors in this latest round is for them to simply base his/her vote on the facts of the case and arguments presented herein and only those facts/arguments. For those who may be nervous and tempted to vote to uphold previous rulings based on the false appearance of consensus, it would be wise to disregard those results since they are indicative of absolutely nothing other than statistical noise \u2013 certainly not of the strength of the individual case arguments and certainly not how another jury is likely to vote afterward. Any claim to the contrary is a fallacious attempt on their part to bluff/scare you into voting a certain way rather than articulating an actual defense of their position based on the facts of the case."

Or does the definition of 'duplicate' also include different tokens that share 'duplicate' (i.e. identical) names/tickers/logos/etc.?\nUnder the former definition, one could argue that the submission should not be removed as it is obviously a distinct token (version) with a unique contract address. Under the latter definition however, it could easily be argued that due to sharing the same ticker name and logo that for the purposes of being listed in the database that it is a duplicate and that this violates the spirit of the \"no duplicates\" policy in the document outlining the T2CR rules.\nThere is also no clarification as to which set of criteria (contract address vs. naming conventions/logo) is to take precedence in determining whether a submission is a duplicate in the event that a token meets one set of criteria, but fails to meet another, as is clearly the situation here.\nFrankly, the fact that the original submitter behind both the Aave v1 and v2 tokens opted to use the same naming conventions and logo between what were obviously two different tokens irks me because this whole dispute could have been avoided by simply not reusing the same nomenclature for both versions. Given that part of the submitted evidence on behalf of are statements from Marc Zeller indicating that 1) the two tokens/versions are intended to be distinct from each other and  2) in the near future, updated naming conventions for each version of the token clarifying this clear distinction are not only to be expected, but actually are likely to be a necessity. Taking this statement at face value it would seem that the original submitter of the v1 and v2 Aave ENJ token is obviously aware of the possible confusion that could be caused by having two separate tokens (with different contract addresses) share the same ticker, logo, and name, but simply doesn't care because he is relying on a very narrow interpretation of the T2CR requirements to argue that because they are not actually duplicate tokens in practice, every other piece of required information describing the two tokens may be duplicative between the two. If this were the case, then why bother having strict requirements for the names, logos, and tickers of submitted tokens to begin with? Per his own words, the submitter is aware of the inherently duplicative nature of the aforementioned details, and yet is pretending to play dumb and not understanding the obvious potential for confusion by focusing exclusively on the fact that at the moment the contract addresses (and only the addresses mind you) between the two tokens are different as sufficient proof they are not duplicates as far as the T2CR is concerned; all while conveniently pretending as if the other variables simply don't exist or don't matter.\nIf a unique contract address was the only piece of identifying information required for determining whether a submission is a duplicate, then surely the T2CR policies would have said so in more specificity would they not? Considering that no such language exists in the T2CR Guidelines, one should not assume that there is a reasonable basis for interpreting the requirements in such a manner. By the same logic, we can also infer that since token name, ticker, and logo are specifically referenced in the context of submission requirements and since past cases have used these factors to judge whether token submissions are duplicative, we cannot simply disregard them now even if a particular novel reading of the established rules makes a plausible argument that they don't matter and never did matter as far as the true definition of \"duplicate\" is concerned.\nFurthermore, however flawed or incomplete the T2CR's language may be when examined with stricter scrutiny, the overall \"spirit of the law\" in having such submission requirements in the first place (to prevent duplicates), is to ultimately serve the end user's and/or community's best interests by ensuring minimal confusion and accuracy of information regarding the tokens are that are ultimately allowed into the registry. Reinterpreting the guidelines in such a way that grants token submitters excessive leeway to submit different tokens with otherwise identical nomenclature and visual appearance (especially when doing so could easily cause confusion and avoidable user errors) arguably inverts the original objective of the T2CR policy so that it is primarily serving token creators first and consumers/the wider public a distant second. \nThe T2CR does not -and should not - operate primarily to benefit token submitters at the inevitable detriment of end users. Especially when the entire issue could have been mitigated by the token submitter/developer themselves if they had simply taken the time and effort to properly differentiate between their multiple tokens at the beforehand and given them unique indentifying qualities before trying to submit them to the registry. \nThe fact of the matter is that the token creators painted themselves into a corner by reusing the same name, ticker, and logo for both versions. And, rather than go back and properly differentiate them before proper resubmission, they opted to submit what they had \"as-is\" and try their luck anyway by claiming that the obviously duplicative aspects between tokens are not actually duplicative (and thus not disqualifying) because those aspects don't really matter anyway.\nSuch reasoning on the part of the submitter (and by extension the challenger arguing on their behalf):\n1) clearly runs contrary to the logic implied by the language in the T2CR submission rules, as well as spirit of the rules themselves\n2) requires a significant and unjustifiable reinterpretation of the submission rules as they are commonly understood\n3) disregards prior case rulings that have upheld using the all aforementioned criteria for determining whether or not a submission is a \"duplicate\"\nFor these reasons, I am thus obligated to vote \"Yes, Remove the token from the registry\" \""

                "description": "This first post (of perhaps several) is in response to the Challenger\u2019s most recent comments:\nI have been following all four Aave token cases (536, 537, 538, and 539) as well as your challenges to the token removal requests from the very beginning.\nYou can wave your money around and arrogantly demean and threaten people all you want, but that does not make your claims any more legitimate or believable. Plenty of jurors and third parties across all four cases have articulated why your position is fundamentally flawed and borderline dishonest and provided much more comprehensive counterarguments than you have to demonstrate support for their side. Rather than address those counter-arguments point by point and refute them (because you can\u2019t), you casually and hubristically ignore them altogether and instead copy/paste the same comments over and over again hoping that enough people here are not engaged enough to notice what you are trying to pull. \nThe \u201cevidences\u201d that you have submitted on your own behalf not only do not sufficiently prove what you are ultimately trying to claim, but upon close examination actually undermine the very claims you are trying to make. Anybody who takes the time and effort to carefully cross-reference and examine all the submitted evidence will see that your entire position relies on poor reasoning, selfishness, and a deliberate disregard for common sense. I will post more refutations to previous comments soon, but in the meantime I encourage all jurors to read the lengthy justification statements previous jurors on the pro-removal side have provided for their votes in Cases 537, 538, and 539. There have been attempts to enter those arguments into the evidence record for prior to voting for everyone to consider but thus far, such efforts have been stymied by the limitations of the Kleros court system interface. In any case, I have copied these arguments (which quite thoroughly destroy the comparatively shallow points made the anti-removal side) and attached them to this comment so that if others are unable to view them in court.kleros.io, they can download the file and read them for themselves.\nLine by line response to the post \u201cArgument Against Removal (NO)\u201d\n\"First, a Uniswap user uses the contract address to search for the token to swap\"\nArguably false, as anyone who opens up the Uniswap app can see that the search menu states \"Search name or paste address\"  Considering that the name (and not the specific contract address) is first and foremost what people will likely use when searching for the token (as it is shorter, easier to remember, and more publicly known hence the reason for having names for contract addresses in the first place), two different addresses with the same name/ticker is both duplicative and confusing. The presumption that Uniswap users automatically \"know\" what to do is a silly and unjustifiable stretch of the imagination. How would an Aave user automatically know which contract address is the one they are supposedly looking for? Where do they find this information if not in the registries and apps (like T2CR) where these tokens are listed? This is akin to expecting users who are not as intimately familiar with these projects as the developers are to be able to either read minds or do burdensome levels of research and verification before utilizing token registries which of course, negates the point of having curated registries in the first place. \n\"Evidently, previous token will be replaced as soon as presented,\"\nThis statement is directly contradicted by the screenshot of the statements of BigMike and Pablo Candela (already submitted into evidence), which indicates both tokens will be active alongside each other for an indeterminate amount of time. Thus, one is not merely replacing the other outright: there will be TWO tokens listed for people to see. How would having them appear in the lists with identical names/tickers/logos NOT duplicative and therefore potentially confusing for people who don't know which one is which?\n\"and given the fact that it shares the SAME NAME with the newer version\"\nAs I will explain in further detail below, this is a completely irrelevant consideration.\n\"what's the point of resubmitting it with 'v1' or 'old' and adding v2 for new ones....when v1 will fade away soon?\"\nAs proven earlier, according to the team behind the tokens v1 will NOT be \"fading away soon.\" The point of resubmitting with different names is to avoid duplicate token listings so that users are not tricked into accidentally buying incorrect or illiquid assets. A possible scenario which is acknowledged by the  screenshot of the text conversation between Marc  Zeller and Santiago Koki (already submitted into evidence). Avoiding such calamity for users is the entire point of having a \"no duplicates\" rule for the T2CR to begin with. \n\"WHY REMOVE TO RESUBMIT TO REMOVE\"\nBecause this is the only way to ensure you are following the submission rules of the T2CR while maintaining the existing nomenclature of the tokens given by the token developers. If they had been given different names/logos/tickers to reflect the fact that they are in fact different, this wouldn't even be an issue \n\"Isn't T2CR more useful without \"unlist\" days of active tokens?\"\nUseful for whom? Token creators who got themselves in a jam and now don't want to do the extra work required to make sure their tokens meet the submission standards? It's certainly not more useful for the end users of the registry who would be at increased risk for being swindled due to duplicate and confusing token listings. This statement of your shows an alarming and almost reckless disregard for the people who would ostensibly be buying your products. Unlisted tokens can always be relisted, but customers who are scammed due to misleading information cannot get their money back.\n\"Isn't it more efficient to retain these until the new completely replaced the old?\"\nRe-read your own submitted evidence and answer me this: are they two completely different valid token assets or is one totally replacing the other and taking its place? Your side has played dumb and claimed both at the same time to try and worm around the fact that each position ultimately fails the requirements for inclusion into the T2CR in its own way. You are trying to argue each angle in a vacuum hoping no one else notices, but I do. Pick one position and stick with it because you can't have it both ways.\nResponse to the post \u201cbulleted arguments and rebuttal attached\u201d\nYou asked the question \u201cLastly, which line in the policy supports the token removal?\u201d:\nI know you meant for this to be a rhetorical question, but the actual correct answer to the question \u201cwhich line in the policy supports the token removal?\u201d can be found in Bulletpoint #6 the official T2CR policy document where it states \u201cIn the case of duplicates, only the first submission should be accepted.\u201d The two token versions are identical in all relevant aspects other than contract address, thus arguably making them duplicates \u2013 which would then necessitate removal under the policy line stated above.\nThe Challenger also cites previous cases where tokens were rejected due to (allegedly) relatively minor incongruities in the visual format of token logos as a basis for not wanting to create bad precedents based entirely around arguing over increasingly granular technicalities. Aside from the ironic fact that the challenger is essentially employing the same sort of flawed reasoning he is deriding here to advocate for his own position, these cases are irrelevant to the current issue at hand because those cases revolved around token logo compliance in accordance with the specified formatting rules in the T2CR policy (in other words, comparing the submission itself against the policy). This case however is not focused on that \u2013 it is different and much more abstract. Cases 536, 537, 538, and 539 are about comparing a submission against another submission and then subsequently determining whether that comparison sufficiently violates the \u201cno duplicates\u201d policy in the T2CR guidelines. I believe there is no argument to be made that it does not, because the token submitter and those on the anti-removal side have already conceded that the name, logo, and ticker ARE duplicative of an earlier submission (the version 1 token), but that it really shouldn\u2019t matter because if you examine closely enough, one can see that the contract addresses are in fact different. In summary, the previous rulings in cases do not apply here since they were in essence about completely different issues.\n\n\nFurthermore, the main argument of original submitter of the version 2 tokens, as well as those in the anti-removal camp, is just a thinly veiled attempt at sympathy rather than an argument that is based on anything substantive. Reading between the lines and paraphrasing, I am seeing a lot of this on the part of the anti-removal side:\n\u201cWe\u2019re just following the rules as they\u2019re written! The proper and commonly used names happen to be the same!\u201d\n\u201cThe guidelines state no duplicates, but we can\u2019t help that our version 1 and version 2 tokens (by admission two completely different tokens with unique addresses) are identical in every other aspect! Yes, it is potentially confusing, and we admit that, but if you made us follow the rules like everybody else our token wouldn\u2019t be eligible! It\u2019s not fair to us! We might even have to remove and re-submit our old tokens! Think of all the extra work might have to do to make sure consumers aren\u2019t hoodwinked!\u201d\nSpare me.\nNever mind the fact that their own conversations (submitted by their own side as evidence) contradict the notion that they have no idea why there would be now be controversy over the name and appearance of both token versions as they are currently labeled. As stated earlier, they are instead pretending to be oblivious and/or innocently dumb about what the dispute is inherently about and choosing to blame the challengers and the authors of the T2CR guidelines for what is in reality the token submitter\u2019s own failure to do their due diligence and properly differentiate their obviously different tokens in accordance with the T2CR policies. Policies I might add were published in the public domain well beforehand and thus any claim to ignorance on the matter defies credulity. \nOne could make the argument that the T2CR guidelines should be revised and clarified in the aftermath of this case so submitters have better idea of what constitutes a duplicate submission, but to argue that the submitters of the token are being held to an retroactively arbitrary and unfair interpretation of the \u201cno duplicates\u201d policy is quite frankly a bit insulting to everyone else\u2019s intelligence; and taking such a claim at face value requires one to suspend disbelief and assume that Marc Zeller and his associates did not in fact believe what they were telling other people about the ongoing plans for both token versions at the time they were saying it. (These conversations have been submitted into evidence for cases 536, 537, 538, and 539 and can be viewed by everybody participating in the case. I encourage everyone here to do so and see the contradictions for themselves).\nIt is not the fault of the T2CR policies, nor is it the fault of those on the pro-removal side that the developers/submitters foolishly chose identical common-use names, tickers, and logos for both token versions when 1) they knew they were not the same tokens, as evidenced by the unique contract addresses 2) would be used concurrently and never at any point be the same until the version 1 was eventually phased out and 3) would in fact necessitate further differentiation in name/logo/ticker in due time - which is largely what they pro-removal side in all of these cases is using as a (quite reasonable) basis for arguing why the two tokens/versions should appear differently in the registry to begin with. \nPhrased another way: it is not necessarily a failure of the T2CR guidelines that in order to comply properly with the \u201cno duplicates\u201d policy as it is written, the Version 2 token would have had to have been submitted with the commonly used name/logo/ticker which also happens to be the commonly used name/logo/ticker of another (and apparently entirely separate) token that was previously submitted and accepted. This is underlying basis for the sympathy angle the token submitters and anti-removal party is angling for (as if to imply that the submitter\u2019s hands were unfortunately tied in the matter), but it doesn\u2019t stand up to basic scrutiny. While on its surface, this may seem like an unfair catch-22 situation for the token submitters, in actuality it is not and such an argument on the part of the anti-removal party is (in my opinion) entirely disingenuous. I will explain further:\nThe \u201cno duplicates\u201d policy has a clear intention and while perhaps not exhaustively specific, it is nevertheless clear enough that anyone with common sense and basic reading comprehension can understand it and tailor their token submissions accordingly to comply. If your tokens are, by your own design and implementation, going to be in violation of the stated T2CR policy from the very beginning; then simply put that is YOUR problem not the T2CR\u2019s. No one is forcing you to submit your tokens, no one is changing the rules/standards after the fact, and no one is preventing your from asking pertinent questions of the Kleros T2CR team and getting confirmation of the policy\u2019s nuances before you spend the time and money submitting them for evaluation. \nYou may not like it. It may have been an honest mistake or oversight. You may think it is unfair. You may even think it highlights an obvious ambiguity in the T2CR guidelines that needs to be addressed (I for one agree that it does), but the bottom line is this entire clown show could have been avoided if those behind the original token submission planned their own projects and implementation schedules better. \nNow, instead of owning up to their error and re-doing things properly, they are hoping to convince enough people here to twist their own understanding of the definition of the word \u201cduplicate\u201d so that they may not only escape the negative consequences of their poor decision-making, but actually profit from it \u2013 regardless of the obvious negative effects this could have on the quality of the T2CR registry and the consumers who rely on it for accurate information.\nA sane and rational person would vote for removal of the token, as a vote to allow the token would forever enshrine the right of token creators going forward to recklessly create and submit tokens with haphazard, confusing, and even borderline deceptive nomenclature while still being in compliance with the T2CR policies. The result would mean more unnecessary risk and uncertainty being taken on by the end users who essentially will no longer be able to rely on the T2CR to vouch for the legitimacy of tokens (or information regarding the tokens) since users would be forced to consult multiple other sources to be reasonably sure of what they are seeing/buying. A vote to allow the token to remain constitutes a clear lack of enforcement on this matter and would signal to the entire community the T2CR guidelines and submission standards are a joke and are not intended to be taken seriously. Anything other than a vote to remove the tokens in question would ultimately cripple the T2CR\u2019s legitimacy and usefulness as a registry. \nThe risks to the people who use the registry in good faith far outweighs the immediate economic considerations of the token creators/submitters, who are in this entirely avoidable situation largely due to their own poor choices and lack of forward thinking. A vote to remove the token is only a temporary inconvenience to them and does not in any way prevent them from making the proper adjustments to their tokens and resubmitting them for future inclusion to the registry. A vote for inclusion, however, forever hurts the people/community that uses the T2CR and who have an enormous stake in the outcome of this case despite bearing no responsibility for the sequence of events that led us here."

The other group believes this should be removed to benefit the quality of the T2CR and protect (third party) users of the list from confusion and potential financial loss.\n\nThis has caused an opportunity for people to clash in highly polarized cases.

(Simply uploading the second version first would cause a duplicate in name + ticker to exist in the T2CR \u2013 clashing with policy).\n\nI believe there is no reason to challenge the removal of the v1 aTokens, since the list would benefit from a proper upgrade to v2. The old tokens can, but should not be reuploaded with an [OLD] or \u201cv1\u201d addition.

That way, Aave YFI (v1) and Aave YFI (v2) will be indistuinguishable for users of the Kleros tokenlist. The only difference would then be the contract address, which would be very confusing for T2CR users. There needs to be a difference between the data of old and new/migrated tokens, so at least one of the following:\n1. Different name;\n2. Different ticker;\n3. Different logo. \n\nIn the T2CR, there are 0 instances of submissions with the same name, ticker, and logo. Couple of months ago, when all the removals of migrated tokens got challenged, note that only those were challenged, where there was a difference in name, ticker, or logo. That is because having two submissions in the T2CR with the same name, ticker, and logo, will be confusing for T2CR users, but also for Kleros tokenlist users. \n\nA difference in either the name, ticker, or logo can be seen at for instance the following tokens: \n1. Augur: Ticker (REP and REPv2);\n2. Aeron: Ticker (ARN and ARNX);\n3. Autonio Ticker (NIO and NIOX);\n4. UniCrypt: Logo;\n5. Eidoo: Name and Ticker (EDO and PNT);\n\n(note that some old tokens still got removed from the T2CR, for instance REP, but that reason was because of incorrect centering of the logo, so unrelated to this case).\n\nIn conclusion, we should NOT allow duplicates (same name, ticker, and logo) into the T2CR. In order to update the T2CR, we need to submit the new Aave tokens, as the old ones will be used less and less, and the new ones more and more. Someday soon the v1 tokens will be depreciated, and the v2 will be the only active Aave token. I am not saying we can't have the v1 tokens in the T2CR, they just ought to have a different name, ticker, or logo, from the new v2 tokens. We can debate about the correct naming convention we should follow in the juror chit-chat on Telegram. We need to re-submit all the v1 tokens to the T2CR, but with a different name. I would vouch for using v1 behind the name, I think that's more slick than (OLD), which aggregators seem to prefer. What is certain, however, is that the last 4 remaining Aave v1 tokens need to be removed from the T2CR, so that we can start adding the v2 tokens to the T2CR, using the correct name.\n\nLastly, I want to react to the following fallacy: \nChallenger: \"If not for one address that was drawn twice, results would have been different.\" \nMe: \"All the Spanish guys are acting like a mob. If there is something which had an influence on all these cases, it's the fact that the Spanish community is all voting the same way, in a group.\""

But the point being is, there\u2019s no consensus in removal unlike the parallel case 539 where it is in agreement that version 1 Aave KNC should be retained. \n\nThere\u2019s no lies in the evidence presented as the requester was claiming. The previous submissions were due to logo, not duplication. S/he just didn\u2019t understand. A duplicate is exactly the same, how can it be a duplicate when the token contract address is different?\n\nAlso from a previous dispute https://tokens.kleros.io/token/0xfa437de067bb335b6861c3adaf6a3075e22344594400c99008ae08f8a2c7b55f where the requester is the challenger, his reasoning supports that there\u2019s NO NEED TO  RENAME version 2 tokens which also implies no reason to re-submit as Aave YFIv1 since it\u2019s not used anywhere."

The v2 tokens need to use the correct name, so in this case, Aave YFI (aYFI). Once these last 4 v1 tokens are removed, they can re re-submitted again with a - non-duplicate - name.\n\nIf I would have added the v2 token of Aave YFI to the T2CR before removing the old one, the challenger would have challenged me too, but then for submitting a duplicate. He is just trying to find something to challenge me on, although I would understand if he would have challenged for duplicates. Because, we shouldn't want to have duplicates (same name, ticker, and logo) in the T2CR, as that would only cause confusion among users of the Kleros tokenlist. There needs to be a distinction between the old v1 - depreciating - tokens and the new - staying - v2 tokens. As the v2 tokens will remain, they need to use the correct names, so Aave YFI in this case. \n\nThe challenger is lying about the reason for the rejections of Marc's submissions, which was not, as the challenger is trying to pursway, only because of the logo quality. All his submissions were also challenged for being duplicates, you can see that in the cases yourself.\n\nLets keep the T2CR a usefull list of curated tokens, which users can use to trade on Uniswap, and for more. We can't allow duplicates in this list, which is also against the policy of course. Just like all the other Aave v1 tokens which were already removed, these last 4 need to be removed as well, in order to be able to add the v2 tokens to the T2CR. Lets not make this too much of a hassle, as it's certainly necessary to remove these last 4 tokens.\n\nPS. CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap are simply not up to date, as they still have the old tokens listed only. They are no valid source in this case, as they are outdated. As can be seen with other projects, they usually list the new tokens, and use (old) behind the names of the old tokens. In the case of Aave, I would suggest to use \"v1\" behind the names when re-submitting them to the T2CR."

Of those ten results nine one of them mention \"GasToken\" and one of them (Coingecko) uses \"Gastoken\" on the title but proceeds to use the correct naming \"GasToken\" in the description.\n\nMost sources use the naming \"GasToken\" and that includes the official sources of the token. That makes this a quick and easy case to solve. I vote to accept this listing. See the PDF attached for evidence."

That sites, that work as reference for searching cryptoassets, have certain mechanisms for changing the names, logos, etc., It is easy, but not so easy. You have to put in contact with them, demonstrate that they are wrong, and wait untile the change is effective. That provides the consensus some sturdity, which is important to make a long live list.\nInstead, anyone with some followers could make blog posts, tuits, etc. naming the asset as he/she wants, changing a letter, or putting a space in between the words, or directly changing the whole name. Should we take that as consensus? In the long term, if you want a new name to be accepted you should produce all that changes, and, at the end,  the TCR will reflect the changing the name, or logo, or whatever. Obviously, the creators of the project, which name it in their web site as GasToken (recently changing their initial naming, which they themselves wrote in the contract), are producing tweets, etc., calling it in that way. But the consensus at the time of uploading is clearly Gastoken.\nThat is the reason why the cryptoasset sites are important. TCR should reflect the state or the art at the moment of uploading. And the state of the art at the moment of uploading in this case is Gastoken. Our list is not for making a reality, is a list for reflecting an already existing reality.\n\nIf, in the future, another name is being used, the TCR entry will be changed, as occurred with many, many tokens.\nAnother important point is that we should be respectful with the work of the challengers. The challengers are who, by constantly revising the list, provides the needed integrity to this list. Without challengers this list does not exists, Kleros does not exists. There are challengers taking the job, and risking their money, in revising even the old tokens to remove them if wrong and uploading the new versions. We cannot change the rules every case. That would be against ourselves, which are PNK holders.\nAnd please, 0x8DcA, don't threaten to the last juror on this round, it's disrespectful, even more, don't helps you.\nThis submission must be denied, and replaced by a new one respectful of the today\u2019s consensus."

I can do the same for \"GasToken\" references, by just Googling and selecting all the websites which use a capital letter T. In fact, Googling \"gastoken\" gives me more hits of \"GasToken\", than \"Gastoken\" on the first page. All we can conclude is that there exists no consensus around one capitalization. In that case, we have to watch at the policy, which states the following:\n\n\u27a4 Names should be treated like brand names (spelling wise). This means that the correct spelling is dictated by the project owners, unless consensus forms around a different spelling.\n\nEvidently, no consensus exists around either \"GasToken\" or \"Gastoken\". Thus, according to the policy, the correct spelling is dictated by the project owners, which is clearly \"GasToken\", as can be seen on the official website and GitHub. \n\nI want to urge the remaining juror, and potentially future jurors, to vote YES. There is no reason to reject this submission, as it's the correct and official name of GST2. If this submission would be rejected, then it will never be allowed to enter the T2CR, as \"Gastoken\" is not the official name and no clear consensus exists around this name. Let's keep the T2CR a functional list of curated tokens, instead of rejecting perfectly fine submissions. "

(And the policy doesn't even mention anything about capitalization). \n\n2) 0xf83... is confusing and swaying jurors by literally spamming the evidence section with very low-quality attempts. Matter of fact: he posted 5 out of 12 evidence posts, that's (>40%).\n\n3) The last juror can now decide the outcome of this round. One thing is for certain, if this gets rejected, another round will follow. Only jurors consistent with the last round's outcome will reap the rewards.\n\n4) Attached to this post, you can find a visual presentation of the GasToken website and their mention of GasToken highlighted in yellow. It even uses \"GasToken\" to refer to the asset in the \"GST1 vs GST2\" section. For more sources, just scan Twitter and GitHub.

This means that the correct spelling is dictated by the project owners, unless consensus forms around a different spelling.\nWe can either say that a consensus has been formed for GasToken, or that no consensus has been formed since both t and T are used about evenly- in which case we would go back to the original clause: the correct spelling is dictated by the project owners. Consensus means a widespread agreement, which evidently there is not. Therefore even if, hypothetically, it was 51% Gastoken 49% GasToken, we could not say a consensus has been formed, hence the name is determined by the owners as GasToken. Furthermore, the T2CR does not mention that reference websites should be given more weight than what the community demonstrably calls it. These websites are centralised and can easily be changed by a form, so coingecko in particular is not the final word here. This is in a way why the T2CR exists, to set precedents for these websites, such as the uniswap list. I hope that this argument is convincing for the final juror.\nMore evidence:\nhttps://blog.polymath.network/turning-smart-contracts-into-gastoken-factories-3e947f664e8b?gi=6da2b9233970\nhttps://etherscan.io/address/0x0000000000b3F879cb30FE243b4Dfee438691c04\n(public tag is GasToken.io)\nhttps://www.saturn.network/blog/save-fees-with-gastoken/\nhttps://corepaper.org/ethereum/state/gastoken/\nhttps://www.reddit.com/search/?q=gastoken"

I did the request because the current logo violates jurisprudence, as shown by my extensive 23 rejections/removals tokens list. On top of that, a piece of the logo was cropped away, thus also violating the policy rule that the logo must be fully included. Also for this, a precedent exists to reject/remove such tokens.\n\nAnd why on earth are you talking about \"Sneaky tactics\"? What is my sneaky tactic here? Please elaborate...

The Amrosus (AMB) token symbol is perfectly centered, as the shawdow of the logo should be included as well (see attachment). So, that leaves the challenger's evidence with only 1 token in the T2CR which does not have a centered token symbol. Because there is currently one token in the T2CR which does not have centered token symbol, does not mean it's valid. It might have been added to the T2CR, before the policy rule about centered token symbols was enacted. Or it might have accidently gone true the vetting system of Kleros. Because something did not get challenged, does NOT mean it's 100% a valid submission.\n\nThe list of removed/rejected tokens for exactly the same reason - token symbol not being centered - is much bigger. I quickly put together a list of tokens which all got removed/rejected for not being centered. Some of them are even more centered than the Kleros logo, and still got removed or rejected. \n\n1. BNS, 2. SUB, 3. SPD, 4. MOD, 5. REP, 6. FTX, 7. KRL, 8. MYB, 9. ECOREAL, 10. DLB\n\nThe Kleros token symbol is even not centered on BOTH the X and Y axis. The policy is clear when it comes to centering: \"It should be centered\". Of course there is always room for human error, but in the case of Kleros it's not human error. It's simply not centered, by a big margin. As shown above by the list of at least 10 similar removals/rejections, there is also a clear precedence for removing Kleros (PNK) using a uncentered token symbol. "

Also the challenger once again provides no evidence to back up any of his claims. But all of this is not that important, as there is no real Opus community we have to use aggregators like CMC and CG to decide what the most commonly used name is, like it has been done many times before. Old posts, only by the team itself, are not enough to decide. The token is listed as Opus on CMC, CG, Etherscan, and many other aggregators too, while it is only occasionally referred to as OPUS in some posts by the official team. All of this can be seen in my previous evidence. OPUS (all caps) is clearly a less common version of the name, because we also have to take into account aggregators. Plenty of submission have been and are rejected based on the names seen on CMC and CG, especially for very minor tokens with no real community behind them, like in this case.

The requester uploaded a zoomed in version of the logo, making it look more pixelated than it really is. I will attach a copy of the T2CR's UniCrypt logo. As you can see, there is nothing pixelated about this logo. The logo complies with the TCR standards, and is definitely NO reason for the removal of this token. \n\nAccording to jurisprudence, this token should remain in the TCR. I want to urge the jurors of the appeal to vote coherently with recent similar cases, thus voting NO. "

Checking the asset folders (https://github.com/Trendering/dapp) will show that there are multiple variations and uses of the exact same grey background, and the availability of a version of the transparent as an asset, which does not make it the correct logo nor support challengers claims. 3) Challenger claims (knowingly) incorrectly that Twitter and Telegram cannot be used to check tranparency because those websites add backgrounds to logos, when it is completely evident that they are using the grey background submitter by the trendering team which has been well established and confirmed to be part of the logo. 4) The listing of a group of lesser used and non-official sources which could have been added or changed by challenger does not refute the fact that grey background is confirmed part of logo, and has been used everywhere official as part of logo. You cannot just repeat selective evidence while refusing to address more powerful evidence to the contrary, nor would the changing of CoinGecko logo been necessary if you truly believed you were in the right here. 5) I do believe that certain aggregators actually do use only background-removed versions of logos and have TRND listed with the transparent version, such as CMC.

My only regret is that this was crowdfunded while I was asleep. You are not correctly following the listing criteria, you are only arbitrarily obsessing over a single word in contradiction to criteria over correctness of logo and the absolute fact that it has been applied for non-transparent logos consistently in the past. The transparent logo rule has clearly been established as intending to prevent bad photo editting by keeping white backgrounds which are not supposed to be in the logo. No one is disputing that the token founder would be fine with having different versions of the logo listed, only that the grey background is inclusive and correct regardless. Even if you were to convince the founder to  change to a rainbow or completely blank logo tomorrow, the case would still not be to your favor as it was completely correct at time of listing and has only become incorrect as a result of your manipulation, which is dishonest and fraudulent in every sense of the word, in the same way your  non-neutral questioning of founder is (which you can compare to when I asked founder, which was completely neutrally stated). For the millionth time then: 1) Grey background is 100% confirmed part of logo and has been used in every representation of the token put forward by the Trendering. 2) Precedent dictates that the correct logo is submitted, even when not transparent. See huge list above and countless other cases on Kleros. 3) Challenger is manipulating and fraudulent, in changing listings, presenting faulty evidence, misdirecting and misrepresenting (see above). 4) If you have been around since old kleros forum days, you already know that submissions are intended to favor submitter. This has been stated by founders multiple times. 5) The fact that you are trying to win this case by spamming no new information but only distracting jury and failing to address what I have pointed out multiple times is pathetic. Only reasonable thing I see is that you have muliple high-stake wallets and hoping to outweigh the judgement with them. It seems all rational actors can can see that a case gone to this many rounds is worth putting the effort into and are going against you though. 6) Your dismissal of appeal funder and accusation of polluting evidence section is completely abusive given you are the one polluting the evidence section and fail to address his/her perfectly valid concerns. You realize that jury will see that over a dozen evidence discussions this is all you have done, right? Even if you just use alt accounts to do it, it is still completely transparent to anyone with a brain. 7) I once again humbly request you drop this nonsense - I don't care about the money, I am here to contribute, but this type of frivolity is awful for the Kleros ecosystem. You are literally arguing for refuse a completely valid listing, which has been proven correct, confirmed consistent with application on T2CR, actively funded and argued for, with absolutely no evidence except for the fact that there is also another logo which could be used, which has not contradicted the fact that the logo used is 100% correct.

Even considering this, how the aggregators use their logos in other instances would be compared to how it is used on T2CR (precedent), which would confirm using the full logo is correct. In any event, it is the correct logo that is required, not the most commonly used (contrary to policy on names, which require most commonly used name). 3) Your repeated misdirection and assertion does not change the absolutely established reality that \"the token for Trendering token is inclusive of the grey background\", regardless of whether there are 50 other renditions of the logo available all with different background colors and levels of opacity and transparency.

So basically there are at least 10 relevant sources using the exact same logo as I provided, while only CoinGecko and Etherscan use another logo (note that CoinGecko and Etherscan don't use the exact same logo as each other). \n\nFurthermore, the requester argued that the submitted logo is the project logo, which is a baseless argument, without any proof backing up his false claim. Don't just blindly belief what he writes, as he is just fabricating unproven evidence to sway the jurors. "

It is clear even based on the screenshot submitted by requester that the black background image is the logo for Dock the project and not Dock the token - the underlying asset being listed here as confirmed by the policies. Requester's claims to the contrary regarding the alleged outdated listing and the 'officiality' of their selection are unsupported and based on nothing but their own misconceived opinion. That requester accuses me of malicious action in an innocent situation where I simply did not want to share my bookmarks bar and open tabs and which bears no support for his argument if he had paid attention to his mistake being pointed out in earlier evidence regarding token vs project is plainly ridiculous. As it is simple to illustrate the reality that requester's logo has not, and the etherscan and coingecko logo have, been in use uninterrupted for years as the most commonly used representation of the token, there is no reason to approve this request."

But then still, it would only be 2 sources, against 7 sources (from which 6 are official). \n\n2. The requester is falsely claiming that the only instance of the logo on the Dock website is not square and contradicts my claim. I attached a screenshot from the Dock website, and as you can see, the black token symbol is displayed at in the tab. The challengers (maliciously) cut this part away in his screenshot. Moreover, the black colors also are used in the project logo (displayed at the left top corner of the page and on the bottom left of the page *not visible in my screenshot though*). The logo that the requester is referring to in his evidence clearly is NOT the token symbol. This is an image about Apps built on Dock, note how the shape is similar to the shapes of IOS apps. MATH was rejected for using such a logo, as it clearly does not represent the actual token (https://tokens.kleros.io/token/0x19622a0b50c5406f15c5004b50e24d2b0df75219e19a5c1543c53c14fe497fc0)\n\n3.

There is no precedent regarding including or excluding \"network\" in the names of T2CR submissions. There only is a precedent to use the most commonly used name to refer to the ASSET, which in this case is Wootrade (WOO). This precedent is backed by the policy, which states the following:\n\n\u27a4 Names should be treated like brand names (spelling wise).

This difference is not related to size or resolution. 2. I had never denied that the CoinGecko listing was consistent with the logo suggested by challenger - note specifically that I was the first person to even raise this fact in the evidence before challenger had even noted it. My update as at 3/11/20 3:43 GMT was a reflection upon noticing the logo had been changed to the presently uploaded one, and was not a false statement, nor would I have any reason to make such a false statement contradicting my own prior acknowledgement. I further acknowledge that as at 3/11/20 10:23 GMT the logo on CoinGecko has been changed back. I deny that this takes any weight away from the case which has been argued from the start, namely that the logo was correct and the most widely used at the time of listing. 3. Challenger is confounding the meaning of 'channel' in this instance where it was indicating 'mechanism of communication', the official community channels of which have primarily been the telegram, discord, twitter and medium pages which have been presented in previous evidence, where it can be confirmed it is still as of present time not shown a single time. 4. At time of submission, there was NO logo on etherscan, so the update does not make the submission retroactively incorrect as it should be judged at time of submission. 5. Challenger is grasping at straws to justify his mistaken belief of 'incorrect logo' when the logo perfectly represented the asset at the time of submission and was explained as such and acknowledged that the listing should be removed if and when this ceases to be true. This would not be justification for breaching justice in this case and ruling against it, otherwise a precedent is set which encourages indefinite appeals by losing challengers until inevitably an update is made, meaning only well established tokens would be listed here, providing an incomplete and outdated set permanently and severely hindering the potential of the ecosystem. The fact that challenger has not bothered to fairly evaluate the arguments made and engage in good faith while throwing accusations of falsity shows intent of challenger here is not to allow the case to reach a just resolution adhering to the policies, but only to serve their own self interest."

Referring to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko their logos is useless, as they always have low-quality logos, which are usually poorly cut from a background, and even sometimes parts of the logos are cut away. I now provided two different official COV token symbols, both DO NOT include any white edges, so obviously it's not a feature of the logo, like it never is. Numerous submissions have been denied because of such white edges, so there is a clear precedent. The requester just did not do enough due diligence, as he should have used an official logo, from an Covesting source, and not a random he one found online somewhere.

But the white edges are a feature of the token, so it can't be considered of low quality just because of that. The challenger claims that only the logo on CMC contains white edges and not the one on CG, this is not true. While the logo on CG is just a few pixels and it is hard to see the brightening towards the edges, the jurors will be able to see that the logo is not a solid color, but has a whiter shade on the outermost pixels. The jurors can easily inspect the logo on both CMC and CG to notice the brightening of the black towards the edges. Of course in the larger version originally submitted to the TCR the whiter part is more easily seen, but that does not mean that the originally submitted version is not consistent with the one found on CG and CMC. This should be enough to prove that a version of the logo that gets whiter towards the edges is not only perfectly fine but also the only version consistently used across aggregators. The challenger mistook a perfectly fine feature for an editing mistake. The logo can only be accepted if it presents this feature, since it is consistent with the major aggregators, as shown above."

I attached screenshot of \"only\" a 300% zoom of the requester's logo, showing the white edges much stronger than the noise of the logo I provided. And after all, it does not really matter how my logo looks, since I did not make this submission. What matters is the fact that the requester submitted a low-quality logo, and thus should be rejected.\n\n2. Also, acting like those white edges are a feature is just trolling. Additionally, the requester incorrectly claims that the logo used on CoinGecko also contains these white edges, which is simply not true and can be seen in my previous pdf file. Moreover, acting like I am just adding confusion to this case is nonsense too. I provided the exact images together in a pdf file, to display the different logos. \n\n3. I will refrain from adding more \"confusion\" to this case. I think the jurors have enough evidence to make a proper judgement. Many submissions have been rejected from the T2CR, or have been removed lately, because of the exact same reason, namely white edges around the logo.

The challenger also keeps referring to the white edge as an editing mistake, while once again it has been proven that it is part of the most widely used version of the logo. In his last piece of evidence the challenger quickly dismisses both CMC and CG, while in the past those have been the standard when ensuring that the correct and most widely used version of a logo had been submitted. Of course the exact image files used on both of those websites cannot be used on the TCR because of size issues (it has never been said that they should), but an analysis of both the CMC and CG logo clearly points to the fact that the white edge has to be part of the logo if the token is to be accepted in the TCR. Quality is an important aspect of the TCR and another equally and maybe more important aspect is consistency, and it has been proven multiple times in the past that both CoinGecko and CoinMarketCap are the go to when ensuring that the most widely used version of a token name, ticker, or like in this case, logo, has been used in a TCR submission. Unless the challenger has useful evidence to present I would kindly suggest to stop bringing confusion into this case with other conflicting information, like he has already done before when claiming that his clearly inferior version of the logo with noticeable image noise (as can be seen in the previously attached document) was better than the originally submitted one, where no noise is present, and then conveniently ignoring the proof that his version was worse."

Now suddenly the token symbol is not centered, which is a baseless claim. There is a small amount of human error possible, we are not robots, we can't crop an image with 100% precision.\n\nContinuing to the previous discussion, it's necessary to keep this token in the TCR, as it is even still being traded on Uniswap as we speak. Both REP and REPv2 are actively being traded on Uniswap, so why should we remove this token from the TCR? That would just be dumb. On top of that, there are numerous of more possible use cases able by keeping this unique Ethereum token in the token curated list. Keeping the initial Augur token in the TCR is necessary for not narrowing down the use cases of the TCR to only 1 use case. This token should remain in the TCR, because it holds a lot of valuable information. By removing this token from the TCR, a precedent will be set to remove all token swapped, (seemingly) dead projects, etc. This is nowhere stated in the TCR, and we should not want to do this. That would only remove value from the TCR.\n\nFurthermore, there is no ground for the removal of this Ethereum token, which is an unique token on the Ethereum blockchain. The migrated token that the requester is referring to, has another ticker, another logo, AND another token contract address, so they are far from duplicates. The differentiation between the 2 tickers, \"REP\" and \"REPv2\", is enough to protect the unexperienced traders, as people mainly search on tickers. Significantly more, than they search on names. And even if they search on the name, they immediately see that not only the ticker does not match the token they want to buy, but ALSO the logo. At that moment they will most certainly understand that they are looking at another token. There is no confusion possible here. \n\nAs this token holds a lot of information, we SHOULD NOT remove it from the TCR. On top of that, no policy rule exists saying that this submission should be removed. There is ALSO NO precedent. Instead, the policy leans more towards NOT DENYING tokens based on token swaps. And last, but not least, there is enough differentiation between the two tokens (ticker AND logo). Because of all of the above, jurors in this case should vote NO, to keep this token in the TCR."

Removing this token and setting an absurd precedent of rejecting everything, will negatively impact the TCR, and thus also the PNK price. \n\n3.

So there is no way you can compare case 302, with this one.\n\nThe requester made this removal request on the basis of token migration. As we all saw, all similar removal requests have been denied. Only because of that reason, the requester suddenly switched the narrative of his arguments, from token migration, to logo not being centered. \n\nFurthermore, I checked all the data before challenging this removal request, and everything was correct. The logo is not centered by a margin of 3 pixels, this is obviously a neglectible error. There are many tokens in the T2CR, which are not 100% centered, as this is almost impossible when done manually. We cannot expect everyone to use a photo editing program to crop their images.\n\nSo, based on all recent similar cases, this removal request should be rejected as well.

I only own one wallet with PNK, and it's this one. Don't try to sway jurors by accusing me of random shit, this won't help your case, and it's ugly behavior. Now lets continue with the arguments 2. If it is a de facto standard to always capitalize tickers, then why are there a large amount of submissions with non-capitalized tickers in the T2CR? In fact, there is a strong precedent, according to which official ticker capitalization should be used for the T2CR. I will provide a non-exhaustive list of all those submissions: * 9 Compound cTokens, * 15 Aave aTokens (which have temporarily been removed from the T2CR for incorrect names, it was for instance aETH (aETH), while it should be Aave ETH (aETH), * 3 renTokens (renBTC, renBCH, and renZEC), * 2 Synthetix sTokens (sETH and sBTC) - (SBTC even got rejected for incorrect ticker usage) - , * 9 other tokens (RFuel, wNXM, rDAI, bCrv, 0xBTC, vBTC, plDai, LYXe, and mUSD). That's at least 38 submissions in total, all using non-capitalized letters in their tickers. Obviously, the standard for the T2CR is to use official ticker capitalization. Etherscan and Uniswap also follow these standards, but CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko do not. The requester can make up all the arguments he wants, but the evidence speaks for itself. Jurisprudence clearly shows that tickers should be treated the same as brand names, so spelling wise we should follow the official way of writing. For this reason, I also decided to remove Compound UNI (CUNI) for incorrect ticker capitalization, challenge my removal request if you think CUNI is correct :) Attached is screenshot from https://aave.com/aTokens, clearly stating the official ticker spelling. 3. Besides providing a big list of irrelevant sources (yes they are irrelevant, because they hold no authority and the website page views are negligible), the requester also included some incorrect information in it. According to him, AYFI is the ticker on Uniswap, while in reality, they also use aYFI. All the official Aave sources, Etherscan, and Uniswap consistently use aYFI as a ticker, which is also the standard in the T2CR. The Kleros T2CR should not only remain consistent with itself (note all of the 38 submissions with partly non-capitalized tickers), but also with official sources, while also with Etherscan and Uniswap. 4. TL;DR: Not only is aYFI is most commonly used spelling, it is also the official one. Therefore I ask the jury members in this case, but also the Aave REN and Aave YFI case, to vote NO, allowing the T2CR to remain consistent with itself and with relevant and official sources."

But this is even irrelevant, as official sources + Etherscan use aENJ as the ticker. Because of all the above, this submission should obviously be rejected.\n\nFor what reason are you posting about the WOO case here btw? If you want to provide evidence for that case, post it on the WOO dispute, not here. But now that you posted it here anyways, let me refute it. Go look up all of those \"Network\" tokens you listed on CMC, CG and Etherscan. Note how the tokens with \"Network\" in their names in the T2CR, also appear on CMC, CG, and Etherscan like that (with \"Network\" in the name). The only precedent that exists, is that the most commonly used name should be used. There is no such thing as a precedent for always using the word \"Network\" for the T2CR, as the requester is trying to argue."

I only own one wallet with PNK, and it's this one. Don't try to sway jurors by accusing me of random shit, this won't help your case, and it's ugly behavior. Now lets continue with the arguments\n\n2. If it is a de facto standard to always capitalize tickers, then why are there a large amount of submissions with non-capitalized tickers in the T2CR? In fact, there is a strong precedent, according to which official ticker capitalization should be used for the T2CR. I will provide a non-exhaustive list of all those submissions: \n* 9 Compound cTokens, \n* 15 Aave aTokens (which have temporarily been removed from the T2CR for incorrect names, it was for instance aETH (aETH), while it should be Aave ETH (aETH), \n* 3 renTokens (renBTC, renBCH, and renZEC),\n* 2 Synthetix sTokens (sETH and sBTC) - (SBTC even got rejected for incorrect ticker usage) - ,\n* 9 other tokens (RFuel, wNXM, rDAI, bCrv, 0xBTC, vBTC, plDai, LYXe, and mUSD).\n\nThat's at least 38 submissions in total, all using non-capitalized letters in their tickers. Obviously, the standard for the T2CR is to use official ticker capitalization. Etherscan and Uniswap also follow these standards, but CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko do not. The requester can make up all the arguments he wants, but the evidence speaks for itself. Jurisprudence clearly shows that tickers should be treated the same as brand names, so spelling wise we should follow the official way of writing. For this reason, I also decided to remove Compound UNI (CUNI) for incorrect ticker capitalization, challenge my removal request if you think CUNI is correct :) \n\nAttached is screenshot from https://aave.com/aTokens, clearly stating the official ticker spelling. \n\n3. Besides providing a big list of irrelevant sources (yes they are irrelevant, because they hold no authority and the website page views are negligible), the requester also included some incorrect information in it. According to him, AENJ is the ticker on Uniswap, while in reality, they also use aENJ. All the official Aave sources, Etherscan, and Uniswap consistently use aENJ as a ticker, which is also the standard in the T2CR. The Kleros T2CR should not only remain consistent with itself (note all of the 38 submissions with partly non-capitalized tickers), but also with official sources, while also with Etherscan and Uniswap. \n\n4. TL;DR: Not only is aENJ is most commonly used spelling, it is also the official one. Therefore I ask the jury members in this case, but also the Aave REN and Aave YFI case, to vote NO, allowing the T2CR to remain consistent with itself and with relevant and official sources."

                "description": "1. The challenger's argument of consistency is not valid as consistency is neither mentioned in the listing criteria nor applied in T2CR. For example, some successful submissions omit \"Token\" from the name and some other successful submissions include it. Jurisprudence shows that T2CR favors the most commonly used one as opposed to the consistent one. I already showed that the most commonly used ticker is AENJ.\n\n2. The listing criteria specifically refers to token names, not tickers: \"Names should be treated like brand names (spelling wise)\".\n\n3. The challenger said: \"The requester put together a list of coin trackers, which should almost all ignored, as they are not relevant at all\".\nThe challenger shows clear disrespect for justice and T2CR by casually suggesting that the requester's evidence of most commonly used ticker should be ignored.\n\n4. The challenger said: \"Only CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko are relevant, and they capitalize their tickers by default\".\nYes, that is because capitalizing tickers is the de facto standard and T2CR should follow standards. Following this standard is important so that users can distinguish a token's ticker from its name easily.\n\n5. I am not acting as a juror in Kleros courts. However, the challenger has several whale juror accounts and keeps voting in his own disputes. This is ethically very wrong and also against the decentralized vision of Kleros. The challenger's actions prove that he is not interested in justice and the well-being of Kleros/T2CR. You can see that he has been both challenger and juror in disputes 454, 392, 385, 184, 146, 136, 115 and he voted in all those disputes:\nhttp://kleroscan.com/juror/0x4a2c5a0Af8b29cD5Fd8Eb1d02a83150A3ee10488"

You have been farming a lot of PNK with your 69 submissions, so don't accuse me of creating my own centralized list. Of course I will challenge all 3 of your incorrect submissions, that's just logical. The correct ticker spelling shouldn't be AENJ, AREN, and AYFI, but aENJ, aREN, and aYFI.

This jurisprudence was partly formed due to the following policy rule: \"\u27a4 Names should be treated like brand names (spelling wise).

Only CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko are relevant, and they capitalize their tickers by default. But that's not how we list tokens in the T2CR. For the T2CR, we follow the official letter capitalization, so aENJ, and not AENJ (https://aave.com/static/media/aENJ.ed76293b.svg). The correct spelling of the ticker can be found in the token contract on Etherscan, which correctly uses the capitalization as defined by the Aave project owners, aENJ(https://etherscan.io/token/0x712DB54daA836B53Ef1EcBb9c6ba3b9Efb073F40). Also Uniswap uses aENJ as it's ticker. This precedent of using tickers like aETH, can be seen from the following list of tokens which all follow the official letter capitalization, even though CMC and CoinGecko use ALL CAPS BY DEFAULT. All of the Compound tokens (cETH, cDAI, cUSDT, etc), all of the Ren token (RenBTC, RenZEC, RenBCH), all of the Synthetix tokens (sBTC, sETH), Strudel Finance BTC (vBTC), Pool Dai (plDai), LUKSO (LYXe), mStable USD (mUSD), and most importantly, all of the Aave tokens (aETH, aDAI, aUSDT, etc), as how they were accepted to the T2CR, before they were removed for incorrect name usage. They were listed as aETH (aETH), instead of Aave ETH (aETH). To remain consistent, the jurors should reject this submission from the T2CR, after which Aave ENJ can be resubmitted with aENJ as its ticker."

I would not be surprised if challenger is the same wank I've seen in other cases submitting changes to logos around the place to fabricate evidence, given this totally unconvincing twitter account (https://twitter.com/keep3rNetwork) created Nov 2020. The argument is that the checkered pattern on the background of the logo is an error and that it should be a transparent lock. This is refuted by the fact that there is no transparent lock pattern even in your own evidence, and the most official high-res available photo demonstrates it is part of the logo (github).

To say that \"Kleros admins can investigate\" is a poor argument: you're saying that it should be approved, and then only after, admins can remove it later, instead of actually going through the Curation process in which peers can judge whether it qualifies. I personally submitted a request to join the group days ago, and it was never approved, which further supports the argument that you're attempting to hide the activity of the group, or that the accounts in the group are not actual people.

I will, once again, present a list of sources, which all used a logo consisting of a dark circle, instead of a transparent one. 3 of the biggest coin trackers AND ALL of the official Switch sources, consistently used the same dark circled logo. Therefore, it's crystal clear that the logo submitted to the T2CR was NOT the most commonly used logo.  \n1. CoinMarketCap, \n2. CoinGecko, \n3. Coinbase\n3. Switch's Twitter, \n4. Switch's Telegram,\n5. Switch's Medium, \n6. Switch's website, \n7. Switch's Instagram.\n\nIn my previous evidence pdf file you can find a list of some smaller coin trackers, which also consistently use another logo than was submitted by the requester. The requester and the 2 times appeal funder are both unable to give proper evidence, supporting their side of this dispute. Instead, their strategy is argumentum ad hominem. They accuse me of being a dictator and being a secret whale juror. Anyone who knows me, knows that I challenge everything from my own wallet, and know that I am not a whale juror. What I hold in my wallet is all I have. And even if I would have more PNK, that's 100% irrelevant to mention. Stop your personal crusade, it's baseless. I am a long time and active community member, which includes submitting and challenging too. I simply follow the rules of the T2CR policy and existing jurisprudence. Btw, I haven't even funded this 2nd appeal myself, so this shows third-party support for rejecting this submission. Dear jury members of the 2nd appeal round, don't be fooled by the requester's side ad hominem tactics.

I suspect challenger may even own a wallet with high stakes as a juror in the court and hope to favour his own frivolous challenges in this way (not that there is anything currently disallowing this, as discussed in previous evidence and on Kleros Telegram).

The appeal funder purposely ignored all of the arguments made by the challenging party, because he was unable to give a proper response to them. Instead, he just simply repeated the same arguments again, which I all refuted already earlier in this dispute. This inability to respond to any of the challenger's arguments, shows that the requesting side CAN NOT refute the claims made against listing this submission. The fact remains that not 1 coin tracker, nor any of the official Switch media channels, were using the logo which was submitted to the T2CR. All of these sources consistently showed the correct Switch token symbol, which is a dark circle with two crossing arrows inside (from which one is white). This token symbol was the most commonly used token symbol at the time of the challenge, during the complete evidence and voting period, and even until the very last moment of the funding period. This submission was in violation when it was submitted to the T2CR, thus it should be rejected at this moment in time. For that reason, the jurors of the first round voted AGAINST listing this submission. The evidence presented during the initial evidence phase clearly indicated that Switch was in violation with jurisprudence, and thus had to be rejected. The requester, nor any other third party, was able to provide any significant evidence showing that this submission complied to the T2CR standards. Dear remaining juror of this first appeal round, but also the jury members of the next appeal round, I want to remind you of the fact that this submission is in clear violation with jurisprudence. According to strong precedents, the most commonly used token symbol should be used for T2CR submissions. Switch's most commonly used token symbol (see attached file) is evidently different from what was submitted to the T2CR, and therefore this submission should clearly be rejected. Don't be fooled by the (evading) tactic used by the appeal funder. Rule in accordance with the facts, and the fact remains that another logo was submitted to the T2CR, than Switch's most commonly used token symbol. Therefore, I want to urge the remaining juror and the coming jurors to vote NO."

For instance, both Kush.Finance and Hakka Finance were re-submitted, while the disputes of their first challenged submission were still ongoing, and no one challenged their re-submissions (in the spirit of the law). Also, in the past, (seemingly duplicate) tokens have been submitted to the T2CR, while the removal request of the existing submission was still ongoing, and no one challenged it. When an obvious mistake has been made in the initial submission, it's okay to re-submit the token with the correct data. Kleros also works better like this, because then people don't have to wait for many days to submit the token with correct data to the T2CR. Therefore, I suggest the jury to accept this submission.

If the community are uncertain themselves about the capitalization of the token and tend to use the natural \"Growth\" casing that differs from the official, does that mean such tokens will not be allowed to enter TCR? A similar case could be made if this was submitted as \"GROWTH DeFi\" then, as users mostly use \"Growth\" or \"GRO\" when referring to it. Dev claimed (screenshot of Telegram group attached) \"Growth is more formal\", so maybe it is ideal to list it as it is listed in highly frequented sites such as coinmarketcap or Uniswap."

Spelling is mentioned three times and the clause does not leave any place for capitalization ambiguity.\n\nTo the challengers: You're left to either attack the semantics of \"spelling\", or find another different argument to successfully challenge the submission.\n\nCounter-counter-argument for \"This definition of spelling is way too precise for what was intended in the document\":\nCase 302 had a similar fight, and in the end, analytic precise semantics won over possible intended meanings. I urge the jurors to be smart as humans, but as precise and objective as computers. \n\nCounter-counter-argument for \"This definition of spelling is made up, niche, or not generally accepted as true\":\nPlease provide a standarized definition for 'spelling' that includes capitalization.

The challenger claims that the correct asset name is \u201cRebase\u201d, but there is no general consensus that this is the most common spelling to refer to the asset. No evidence has been brought forth to prove his statement either.\n\n2. The company only surfaced in the beginning of August. Both their branding guide and communication complies with using \u2018REBASE\u2019 when referring to the asset. (See source below) On top of this, their token contract also mentions \u2018REBASE\u2019 as the asset\u2019s name.\n\nIt would be extremely strange that there is already a community strong enough for this project, to overrule the general usage and spelling of the asset name by habit. This project is brand new and only has 829 followers on Twitter. For this reason, we should respect their brand guide.\n\nThe jurors who voted NO in the first round have provided no evidence for their decision, even though the submitter took his/her time to make a very compelling and strong piece of evidence in PDF format.\n\nThis will certainly be accepted to the Token List. Challenging submitters that comply fully with the requirements of the T2CR is sad harassment. Kleros will punish this behavior in the last round.\n\nBrand Guide Source: https://medium.com/rebase-capital/what-is-rebase-and-why-the-everywhere-7d7717d65607"

Voting no would make people choose instead to submit to places where information is hidden, so it would not be challenged.\nI am not accusing people of doing this, but engagement on sites where it's easy to create new accounts can easily be faked by liking/sharing your own submission, or sharing it in a group chat to get a few likes/comments, but not actually have the article be read. >700 genuine views goes further to spread awareness than many other accepted submissions, so I hope that the jury votes yes to encourage genuine submissions instead of people trying to game the system."

Jurors voted to accept the submission, as it still satisfied the single requirement of \u201csignificantly expanding the Kleros knowledgebase\u201d (https://bit.ly/3051yOW) despite low engagement. \nTo require engagement plus meeting another criteria would disqualify many of the submissions already registered! On Medium, 1 user can give 50 claps, so the actual number of likes is much lower than displayed. Also, views and shares aren't even visible, so there's no way to judge engagement. Many accepted submissions, many quite good, have relatively low engagement, so to decline this submission is hypocritical, as it is equal. Otherwise, all future and past submissions would need to follow the same standard of meeting a criteria AND having a minimum level of engagement. Vote yes."

That submission dates back to the 4th of July 2019, which was 460 days ago, and a lot has changed in Kleros since. If you read well, you saw that the challenger back then wrote \"According to CURRENT Court policy and jurisprudence, this submission should be without the term \"Token\"\". As I explained before, the guidelines and precedents were different back then. The policy still included the word 'project name', which caused a precedent of only accepting submissions using their project names. After changing the policy to 'use the most commonly used name to refer to the asset', jurisprudence changed too. You can see that there are nowadays more than 30 submissions with a 'Token' or 'Coin' suffix in the name. They all get accepted, because current policy - and jurisprudence - now demands to use the most commonly used name. In this case, the most commonly used name is Atomic Wallet Coin, you can't deny that. The requester is falsely claiming that I posted evidence that 'sometimes' Atomic Wallet Token and 'sometimes' Atomic Wallet Coin is used to refer to this asset, that's not true at all... What I wrote is: MOST OF THE TIME the Coin suffix is used and SOMETIMES the Token suffix. \"Atomic Wallet Coin\"(AWC) is - by far - the most commonly used name, and should thus be used for the T2CR. Second (debatable) option would be to use \"Atomic Wallet Token, as it's still used by some sources. However, just \"Atomic Wallet\" is NEVER used to refer to this asset, and is thus unfit to use as the name for the T2CR. Unfortunately, I have to keep repeating myself, but the policy reads as following: \u27a4 Suffixes such as, but not limited to: \u201cToken\u201d, \u201cCoin\u201d should generally be avoided,\nunless a name with suffix is already well established. In other words: if a suffix is well established, it SHOULD NOT be avoided. In this case the suffix is very well established, as there is no occurrence of a source referring to this asset as just \"Atomic Wallet\". I want to urge the jurors to rule in accordance with the guidelines, which clearly states that the most commonly used name to refer to the asset should be used. I hope everything is clear for the requester and the jury. If anyone has any further questions, feel free to ask them here in the comments. "

Stop trying to put me in a bad light, this is bad behavior and it won't help you in this dispute. Just keep it civil and use arguments to win the discussion, instead of name-calling :).  \n\nOLD POLICY: \"Project names and tickers should be carefully checked\" - The wording of 'project names' indeed created ambiguity, which caused numerous submissions, using the token name instead of the project name, to be rejected. This set a precedent of only using project names for the TCR, instead of the most commonly used name. MakerDAO is a good example of this, where the project name was used instead of the most commonly used name, which is Maker. This was a long time ago, when the old policy was still enacted. If one would submit Maker to the Kleros TCR at this moment, the correct name to use would be Maker, instead of MakerDAO. After the policy change, names in the TCR started to reflect the most commonly used name. Due to the absence of financial incentives, no one however decided to remove MakerDAO from the TCR and resubmit it as Maker. Recent submissions and disputes however shows that the most commonly used name should be provided, which the requester unfortunately did not. I understand requester's confusion, but I ask the jury to follow current court policy and jurisprudence, and not that of 452 days ago. Thus, voting against listing this submission, as both the name and the logo are not the most commonly used."

Two submissions that the submitter is aware of: - MakerDAO (which the challenger conveniently skipped in their statement): https://tokens.kleros.io/token/0x420ad0a6c578dbd237f6ea77c969b4c906bdabb4719e3661c356ad1eecdf9c86 - DigixDAO: https://tokens.kleros.io/token/0xbf162ee983d98b6d954aa49141f0a753f083d29924dbe5ffe39e4cf68f5939b5 \" https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmP9NgKXUE51s9fpLygKjNqCFMJBrPWru4SYWiERcrt96o/imtdefense2.pdf\n\nHeliast even admitted \"when a logo is officially and clearly designated by project members as the token logo, this element is sufficiently objective to be considered as a consensus. - however, when this is not the case, reference should be made to the most commonly used logo on an objective basis. ... Thus, the Submitter is right when he considers that an official logo should prevail over the most commonly used logo (cf. MKR, DGD). But in this case, the submitted logo is never used in an official way.\" https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/Qmc4izfNH63Ccok1vqfx7TJ1uRhuSBWfLJ6ZCS5FLF5SkF/imt2-heliast-ruling.pdf\n\nWith KEEP, there is NO point in arguing about a most widely used logo (even assuming this is a correct objective criterion) because there IS a logo specifically designated as the proper token logo and used in an official way."

Only jurors coherent with the last round will get rewarded.\n\n\nRebuttal:\nI appreciate the effort you made in putting this evidence together. However, upon closer inspection, it should be taken with a grain of salt by any serious juror.\n\n1. You provide an extensive list of 10 submissions that got rejected for being \u201cpoorly cut\u201d. Yet, none of these logos come even close to the quality that this submission has. Matter of fact, 80% of them are HALF (or lower)  the resolution of the KEEP symbol (450px). The other 20% (DMM: Governance & yearn.finance) are of the equal or larger resolution, but incredibly poorly edited. \n\nJurors, please take a look: it is impossible to use this as a comparison to the KEEP logo\u2019s quality.\n\nhttps://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmQKE92YzewWacg9vemXuyMQghnPRsSii4Sg5osUmi1ePS/Bcd7KtTL9jw9vrg1zTnrUfrDxRZvheqstBjyrdi8sftx3bqJPBMKnNU2KHehpVANMYQi5fEibXg2z56bF573KMvpdf\n\n2. You nonchalantly edited in a screenshot of Cl\u00e9ment commenting on a forum post, which is irrelevant. It is a weak attempt at persuading jurors by pointing to \u201cauthority\u201d. Even better, Cl\u00e9ment claims the logo should be of high quality. Since the requester uploaded the KEEP token symbol straight from the KEEP Press Kit, it is hard to argue about it not being high quality.\n\n3. None of your \u201cconsistency cases\u201d is similar to case 385. It is impossible to refer to past cases, where the submitted logo was the -only-  correct token symbol, yet it got rejected."

Let\u2019s be honest here: does this logo look pixelated or blurry? It has been uploaded STRAIGHT from KEEP\u2019s official press kit. It is simply the best resource online for the token symbol. \n\n2. >\u201cThe official KEEP media channels (Telegram and Twitter), CoinMarketCap, CoinGecko, Etherscan, and a bunch of less known coin trackers, consistently use the logo which consists of a mint green background.\u201d. \n\nAgain, there is no policy rule that states the TOKEN SYMBOL should be the same as the PROFILE PICTURES of the project\u2019s media channel. Project logos and token symbols are obviously not the same and can differ. You are creating fallacies here. Even worse: you have no foundation in the policy for this \u201cconsistency issue\u201d. \n\nWould you like to use \u201cjurisprudence\u201d as a last resort?

After all, it is a proposal, nothing final yet. 1. First, the policy proposal will be discussed on the forum, 2. Then, additions will be made to the proposal based on the input of the Kleros community, 3. After most of the people on the forum agree with the proposal, it will be put to vote, 4. Then, it needs to be accepted by the majority of the voters, 5. And last but not least, it needs to be enacted. As long as is it not enacted yet, it holds no power in court. For jurisprudence for this, look at the Robotina case where a policy proposal was even already voted for, but as it was not enacted/executed yet, it has no power in court yet. For reference: (https://tokens.kleros.io/token/0xa5eff5969faa02a390b455672486d8b46e2312fc22f30fb033b4207cc14a4701)\n\nBackground: \nThe TCR is a generic list and the Kleros team nor the community have any power over how other people/dapps will integrate it. They might use it on a light background, they might use it on a dark background, it's up to them to decide. So the argument about the KEEP brand guide which states that the logo shouldn't be used on a dark background, is not relevant for the Kleros T2CR. In fact, the logo with the mint green background would be more fitting for the T2CR anyways, as it will be clearly visible on both a light and a dark background."

The submitted symbol is obviously not blurry, not pixelated overall, but has a tiny edge when paying close attention. Wiktionary defines pixelated as \"an image, having pixels that are large enough to be individually visible from a normal viewing distance.\" The edge does not make the image visibly APPEAR pixelated, so it does not violate the objective policy part to APPEAR pixelated. The token details page makes this clear and the new evidence above discusses why it will not appear pixelated in other scenarios.\n\nAs a Kleros dev wrote: \"Minimum resolution is 128x128 so client applications can\u2019t assume more than that, even if some of the images are bigger than 500x500.\" \"We need symbols to use them as icons, not high resolution, pixel-perfect images.\" https://forum.kleros.io/t/revisiting-t2cr-policy/460\n\nI urge the jurors to be pedantic with the objective part of the policy text and with the spirit of the icon registry, over being pedantic with the logo quality by subjectively applying a standard that is too high, too perfect for some tokens and for some other jurors."

It's easy to say that all previous rulings could be incorrect, but that's just not how it works. Unit Protocol and XIO were both rejected for EXACTLY the same thing as this case. Both were first submitted as round logos, but both got denied, because the most commonly used logos had a squared colored background. All the other disputes I listed in my evidence file were also due to not using the most commonly used logo. You can find that list here: (https://ipfs.kleros.io/ipfs/QmSgwgc8Nac4E4Ebsu4pGknSowLRHn3tRkKePChNrtpYcd/keep-network.pdf). All these disputes are easily verifiable, as you can view each one by clicking on the links that I provided there. 2. It actually does matter a lot that all coin tracking websites + official Keep Network media channels use another logo than you submitted here. If all sources use the same logo, why should we use another logo in the TCR? Additionally, your argument about the Twitter and Telegram logo having a thick green edge around the logo (when viewed in rounded display) invalidates your own submission, because then you would still have provided the wrong logo. Imagine that you submitted the correct logo to the TCR (so with the mint background), then that logo would look EXACTLY the same as on the Keep Network official media channels if viewed in a rounded cropped display. Namely, a black round circle with a thick green edge. I want to urge the jury to follow jurisprudence, and consequently reject this submission. 3. It is your own responsibility to do due diligence before submitting. The fact that you didn't know about following Kleros jurisprudence, is your own mistake, and does not mean that jurors should accept your submission out of pity. When you put a deposit, you basically say that your submission is conform the guidelines AND jurisprudence, or else you risk losing your deposit. This is just how Kleros works. This mechanism makes sure that people are incentivized to make correct submissions, while also incentivizing the Kleros community to double check submissions made to the TCR for mistakes or scam attempts (for instance through fake contract addresses). We cannot allow to step away from jurisprudence, because someone did not know about this. Yes, it can feel unfair to lose your deposit, because you didn't know you had to provide the most commonly used logo, but you knew the risks and rewards of submitting beforehand. The sole reason that you are submitting tokens to the TCR, is because you want to  farm PNK. So saying that it feels wrong to deny this submission is nonsense. You knew about the risks of submitting tokens to the TCR, and you still decided to join the PNK reward program, because you wanted to make profits and farm PNK."

Ruling that the most commonly used logo, which might be with the green background, must be used feels wrong and almost a trap, because as the submitter I never saw that in the guidelines or told that all jurisprudence must be reviewed before submitting. The challenger then wants to forfeit the deposit and submits around 20 cases difficult to review fully or argue over. Some of them were not argued, had other challenge justifications, had the core of the symbol in white or light color needing a background with contrast, etc. No doubt, there is an implied rule the logo must be the actual _token_ symbol (that is the common sense) and the logo should be included in full, which get applied in those cases. As there is no clearly expressed rule that the token must be the most commonly used, concluding this is all what many cases were about could be wrong, or any case that would have ruled on this justification alone could be wrong. Jurisprudence is to be prudent, but there is no court policy that a precedent case must be faithfully followed. An acceptable version of the KEEP symbol was included in full and of quality high enough, so the jurors should side with upholding the clear application of the guidelines, and not scare new users away because of subtilities.\n2. It doesn't matter that coin trackers took the same logo as in Telegram and Twitter, which have a logo about the project and not specifically the transparent token. Actually the resulting displays after Telegram and Twitter rounded the logo show that Keep wants a small green edge to show, for example: https://t.me/KeepNetworkOfficial/ Refusing this submission would fail to accept the _actual_ transparent token symbol and all official features present in the symbol (being in the media kit). The last two arguments about quality are wrong because they ask for excellence and for perfect quality, while the policy asks for a quality high enough. Clement also speaks \"to keep the list high quality\", not perfect quality, in that screenshot (the other rejections like Powerpool had worst quality than Keep). There is clearly some leeway or the policy should be worded differently. If there is any tiny fault in the Keep press kit token, it is not enough to reject this submission."

Common sense and jurisprudence tells us that the most commonly used logo should be used, thus a rejection of this submission should follow. 2. P.S. The Kleros team is striving to create a high quality curated token list with the TCR, and to show how easy it is to provide a high quality, I included the round Keep Network logo in the attachments, without any green anomalies around the logo. I did this within 5 minutes, which shows how little time is needed to create a high quality logo, from a low quality logo.

The transparent background rule only exists to eliminate submissions where the most commonly used logo consists of a transparent background, but where the requester provided a logo with a white background. In the case of logos where a non-transparent background is a feature, logos submitted to the TCR should also have that background. If that background is made transparent, it will violate the following policy rule: \u27a4The logo should be fully included. There was even a case where a submission  was rejected, because the background of submitted logo was transparent, while the most commonly used logo had a white background (see STAKE dispute). The following tokens in the TCR all have a non transparent background: Fetch, Fantom, Crypto.com, Dock, SingularityNET, Maecenas, Swarm City, Swerve, SushiSwap, UniLayer, Unit Protocol, XIO, and STAKE. This evidence invalidates the argument of the requester, that all logos in the TCR must have a transparent background. The CAP dispute is one of the many disputes which set a precedent, that the most commonly used logo should be used, and no other.

It's just the effect of poorly cutting from a green background, making it low quality.  \n\nIn summary, a precedent of using the most commonly used logo has been set numerous times. Thus, the only correct logo for Keep Network (KEEP) is the logo with a mint green background, as it's being used everywhere. I want to remind the jurors that guidelines are never 100% complete, this is impossible. Evidently, jurisprudence clearly shows that the most commonly used logo should be used, even if it consists of a colored background. Submitted logo obviously does not match the most commonly used logo and should therefore be rejected from the TCR."

The Challenger is unaware of the content of my video. because it is not a native speaker, but makes the accusation that my content does not meet the High Campaign requirements.

Which is also not true, but only the speculations and assumptions of Challenger.\n3. The Challenger is biased towards me as an author. Example. The author of Kryptol was left without a well-deserved attention from Chenger. His presentation does not exactly meet the criteria of a high campaign.  No hits. No hits, no retweets. But the Challenger does not notice this.  All this gives me reason to think about the bias of the Challenger and the discrimination of Russian-speaking authors on its part.\nfor more information, see attachment"

I translated it using google translate, and I knew everything before of course. I see that this submission may increase the kleros knowledge, but I cant really see it increasing it _significantly_.

I can submit a tweet with 0 rt, but nobody would challenge it because a month after maybe I could reach the needed shares.\n\nBut it's interesting to see how the submitter and the people supporting him are trying to confuse the jury showing that NOW they have the RT needed.

Multiple Kleros team members who have forged the policy have confirmed the subjective nature of this document.\n\nThe fact that this submission got heavy support from the community to reach the \u201crequirements\u201d  that the Rejecter so cares about, is another reason for jurors to accept this case. This is a beautiful subjective indicator of what a High Impact submission looks like. You cannot find this in the policy, but we, the community, understand it intuitively.\n\nLastly, I advise all jurors to be cautious with the influence of the challenger. He might have a different set of incentives.\n\nOur Community's new artist deserves a fair trial.  VOTE YES."

I produced several twitter threads that reached the 50rt.\nThe Kleros Community example is much more than a tweet, because the map was constructed by the cooperation of more than 150 people who are part of  it. It is a tool that shows the global distribution of Kleros community and was embeded in the official website of the kleros project (kleros.io/community) and third party tools (klerosboard.com/kleros-map) both with hundreds of views every day.\nFurthermore, the map was the first in its class, i.e. the first map of Kleros community ever made.

A meme is an idea [...] that spreads by means of imitation from person to person [...] (Merriam-Webster Dictionary). So a GIF can be a meme. The criterion: \u201e->Are memes related to Kleros or its dapps.\u201c is met.\n\n2. Fulfilling one criterion of the guidelines is enough to be accepted (one submission cannot fulfill all of them, also see the examples given in the guidelines).\n\n3. One of the examples of content already is a GIF like the submission.\n\n4. None of the rules for rejection can be applied.\n\n5. There is no rule stating that submissions to the standard impact list must have a minimum diffusion. Think about it, a tweet directly claims ownership and origin. By submitting just the GIF, @Zn1949 does not claim anything directly. I think it makes perfect sense to accept a GIF posted on a free for all platform and for a tweet to must have a minimum of diffusion. "

        "description": "Introduction\nClaimant seeks compensation for a discrepancy in PNK rewards (71935.48 PNK) he suffered by the Kleros Cooperative\u2019s incorrect moving away of his two January 2020 storytelling submissions to the second timeframe. Respondent had been notified of the issue less than six hours after its sharing of the reward spreadsheet; yet, it has failed to correct the mistake either at the time or after the fact. After months of discussions and leaving the matter pending, the parties cease such efforts and cause a case to be brought to the Kleros Court.\nThe Program Terms and Subcourt Jurisdiction\nThe full information on the previous centralized storytelling program can be found on the Kleros blog, with a 25/02/2020 archive on the Wayback Machine (the \"Program Terms\"). The Program Terms provided: \"In case a participant disagrees with his share of the reward, Kleros Escrow will be used to settle the dispute.\" A summary version of the Program Terms can be found in a previously used primary document for disputes on rewards.\nThe parties have agreed to change the resolution mechanism from the Escrow to the Dispute Resolver for such issues and the Marketing Subcourt was previously stipulated for a related case (no. 167). (See Stipulation [transcript of Telegram chat].) The Kleros Coop did not object to using this specific subcourt for this case. (See July Slack chat [emphasis added].)\nTherefore, the Claimant submits this Marketing Subcourt has the jurisdiction to resolve this off-chain dispute created through the Dispute Resolver.\nFacts\nThe Claimant incorporates herein the facts present in the list of exhibits, primarily found in the email thread, and directs the jury\u2019s attention to its highlighted contents.\nIn short: The publication and submission of the two items were both made on the last day available; the first period was between \u201c10/12/2019 and 10/01/2020\u201d, and 12/01/2020 is \u201cat least a week before the distribution date\u201d (originally planned as 20/01/2020). Therefore, those items should have been included within the first timeframe rather than the second. The first timeframe had very few submissions, making rewards higher. With these items' proper inclusion, their 8 points together should have been out of 50 total points, amounting for 16% of 500000 PNK (that is, 80000 PNK). Because of their improper moving away to the second timeframe and non-resolution of claimant's issue when timely raised, 8064.52 PNK were received instead. (See public spreadsheet at items 33 and 40.)\nTimeline\nAll times in this brief are in Claimant\u2019s local time, that is GMT-4 / ET, except as otherwise noted.\nOn January 12, 2020, shortly before 5:25 PM (the screenshot time), Claimant made a submission of two items via the Google form for the program. (See screenshots of submission, filled out and confirmed.) The Kleros Coop\u2019s spreadsheet shows a timestamp of \"12/01/2020 22:24:13\" (Kleros Coop's time). (See screenshot of timestamp on spreadsheet shared by Stuart.) This was \u201cat least a week before the distribution date\u201d (originally planned as 20/01/2020). (See Program Terms.)\nOn February 4, 2020, Damjan of the Kleros Coop posted in the Telegram group: \u201cwe changed our dynamic a bit\u201d and asked to \u201cdrop all of your submissions directly to myself.\u201d\nOn February 6, 2020, assuming the previous submission must be made again and out of caution, Claimant dropped his \u201cfirst submission\u201d (of items dated January 10th, the last publication day for the first timeframe) via Telegram and had Damjan acknowledge receipt thereof. (See screenshot of first Telegram submission.)\nOn February 25, 2020, at 10:49 AM, Damjan announced the release of a spreadsheet of tentative rewards.\nLess than six hours later, at 4:26 PM, Claimant notified Damjan of the issue in question via Telegram. (See screenshot of notification of issue to Damjan and response.)\nOn February 27, 2020, at 09:20 AM, Damjan responded to get in touch with Stuart. (See ibid.) Notably, Damjan agreed on behalf of the Kleros Coop \u201cwe\u2019re covering the initial dispute fees\u201d in the event of a dispute. (See ibid.)\nOn February 27, 2020, at 6:19 PM, Claimant emailed Stuart. Absent a response, Claimant followed up on March 6, 2020. (See email thread.)\nOver those days and months, the Kleros Coop did not cause a dispute to be created before or after the final distribution, or otherwise resolve the issue, despite claimant\u2019s notice within hours from the first spreadsheet release. However, Stuart raised the possibility to maybe \"send over some more PNK.\" (See ibid. at p. 2.) Claimant indicated he would be awaiting such a possible offer. (See ibid. at p. 1.)\nOn July 27, 2020, the Kleros Coop finally closed the issue as an internal support matter, by deciding \u201cwe won\u2019t make you an offer, nor pay for the initial fees for a case.\u201d (See July Slack chat [emphasis added].) This is contrary to Stuart and Damjan\u2019s previous assertions, respectively.\nThese previous communications were using an earlier figure of 3921.57 PNK that would be rewarded per item, found on a previous speadsheet. The final spreadsheet rewarded 4032.26 PNK in the end. Claimant has been arguing it should have been 40000 PNK for each of the two items.\nThe issue now comes as a Kleros Court matter.\nRelated Case\nIn Kleros Court Case No. 166, the Court resolved a similar issue in Claimant\u2019s favor. The Kleros Coop had rejected an item published on February 11 and submitted on February 12, with the reason as out of timeframe. The publication and submission were both made on the last day available; the second period was between \u201c11/01/2019sic and 11/02/2020\u201d, and 12/02/2020 was \u201cat least a week before the distribution date\u201d (originally planned as 20/02/2020). Had the Kleros Coop forgotten the submission timeframe was a bit longer than the publication deadline?\nBecause that issue B and the issue A here are the same on acceptance of the time of submission in keeping with the Program Terms (these letters A and B were used to identify the issues in the email thread), Claimant should similarly be awarded the rewards to which he was entitled here.\nClaim\nMoving the said two items to the correct timeframe would have meant being rewarded 8% each (40000 PNK each) rather than 0.78% each (4032.26 PNK each). The discrepancy is (40000 x 2) - (4032.26 x 2) = 80000 - 8064.52 = 71935.48 PNK, which Claimant requests for enforcement of the Program Terms and compensation.\nPer the Kleros Coop\u2019s February 27, 2020 agreement through its representative Damjan to be \u201ccovering the initial dispute fees\u201d in the event of a dispute, the Claimant is entitled to recover the 0.30 ETH paid to create this dispute. (See screenshot of notification of issue to Damjan and response.)\nClaimant therefore respectfully requests 71935.48 PNK in compensatory damages and 0.30 ETH in initial arbitration costs.\nList of Exhibits\nJuly Slack chat [emphasis added]\nScreenshots of submission, filled out and confirmed\nScreenshot of timestamp on spreadsheet shared by Stuart\nScreenshot of first Telegram submission\nScreenshot of notification of issue to Damjan and response\nEmail thread (highlighted)\nGo to the Arbitrable Application",

However, Jarvis Reward Token is not well established, as Jarvis Network is used by the most prominent website. If neither of the two names is much more established than the other, a submission should comply with: \"Suffixes should generally be avoided\". Therefore the only correct name for this submission is Jarvis Network in my honest opinion. \n\nI strongly believe that we should follow the strict rules stated in the listing policy. Failing to follow the set of rules given to the jurors will set a bad precedent. As I am not sure how others think about this issue, I will not fund an appeal.

In contrary, the most commonly used name therefore is Jarvis Network, and not Jarvis Reward Token. The metrics of CMC are way higher than those of CoinGecko, thus CMC should be weighted heavier.\n\nThis submission should be denied on the basis of 1. Not avoiding 'Token' suffix, 2. Precendence, and 3. Not using the most commonly used name.\n\nIt is important to have some consistency in the TCR, this I urge the jurors to vote NO to avoid inconsistency. "

It's wordings makes that clear already when it states that applications should be rejected when they have \"mainly fake interactions\". This indicates that we should not ask whether there are at least five real interactions but that we should reject applications with more than half fake interactions.\n\nThis becomes even more evident when we look at the structure of the document. The rule against fake interactions is part of the section beginning with \"and should not be:\" which lists other criteria that lead to rejections such as pornography, stolen ideas or poor encoding. These are criteria regarding the *quality* of the submission. A submission that is made up almost entirely by bot interactions seems unprofessional and suspicious. In no way can such a post be regarded as a positive story to be told. Consequently, it is a poor quality submission and should be rejected."

In those cases, as long as the minimum of interactions (in this case 0 for a meme, not 5 for any other image) is not mainly fake, it should be enough for acceptance. Any post can be subject to suspicious interactions or attacks for rejection (third-party interference was reported in the Kleros juror chat).

This list could well be used to give away something as a promotion. Maybe the hosts would like to differentiate between content even within the standard impact list for impact. Just a meme could be worth less in terms of impact than a tweet with social interaction. So the hosts would decide to give a tweet a higher chance of winning than just a meme.

If a direct link to a meme picture can qualify, it only makes sense that a tweet of said picture would also qualify, paid interactions or not. I'd even argue that the usage of cctip.io is proof of good faith, that the submitter is willing to pay to share the word (which is the whole point of the storytelling campaign), even when it's clear that it's not required. It's not in the spirit of the court to punish the submitter and it will reflect bad on Kleros' reputation if it happens."

In those cases, as long as the minimum of interactions (in this case 0 for a meme, not 5 for any other image) is not mainly fake, it should be enough for acceptance. Any post can be subject to suspicious interactions or attacks for rejection (third-party interference was reported in the Kleros juror chat). Cctip was used in good faith, based on a DeversiFi's positive thought of it (screenshot submitted before), and it would be unfair to reject the meme altogether, or even reject there were at least 50 authentic views (stats submitted before) by just assuming they are mainly fake.\n\nThis submission should be added."

This list could well be used to give away something as a promotion. Maybe the hosts would like to differentiate between content even within the standard impact list for impact. Just a meme could be worth less in terms of impact than a tweet with social interaction. So the hosts would decide to give a tweet a higher chance of winning than just a meme.

Accept a very simple gif (not even a meme) without information on interactions, but reject a meme because the submitter wanted to tip some DOGE, which a DeversiFi admin thought was fine? No. Unlike that basic gif, there is *not* even any need for interactions for memes only, which take more creative efforts by the way. There is no point in rejecting a meme by looking into interactions when the meme is eligible *alone*.\n\nThe restriction on fake interactions makes sense if there is a condition on minimum interactions.

See, this submission title is about a \"Meme\", which is hosted here: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EclPUIpWAAMPpoy?format=jpg&name=large\n\nThe restriction on fake interactions makes sense if there is a condition on minimum interactions. In those cases, as long as the minimum of interactions (in this case 0 for a meme, not 5 for any other image) is not mainly fake, it should be enough for acceptance. Any post can be subject to suspicious interactions or attacks for rejection (third-party interference was reported in the Kleros juror chat). Cctip was used in good faith, based on a DeversiFi's positive thought of it (screenshot submitted before), and it would be unfair to reject the meme altogether, or even reject there were at least 50 authentic views (stats submitted before) by just assuming they are mainly fake.\n\nThis submission should be added."

The knowledge base only argues a bit why to care about the DAO. (First two links referenced the article.)\n\nThere is no requirement to make a \u201cguide\u201d.

There is no reason to refuse a useful elaboration on empowerment, nor has the challenger even attempted to justify any. As a reminder, \u201cother useful content\u201d is another example for acceptance."

The text is useful, novel content that expands the knowledge base by explaining the process and benefits in a novel manner in response to a unique and important question.

In the booking, it does state that payments are non-refundable but the customer didn't see the cancellation fee until after she booked it.\nThe customer contacted Travala but was told that they have no control over booking policies of the property and was advised to wait until there might be a change in policy. The customer insisted that she is legally not allowed to leave her country nor enter Italy at that time and hence insist on getting the refund through Travala at least.\nTOS: https://www.travala.com/terms-and-conditions\nGo to the Arbitrable Application",

Doing a lot of things, struggling with traffic jams to hit deadlines, and quality time is seasonal. With the sudden surge of virus scarcity, everything has turned upside down.\nAccording to an economist, the \"new normal\" is happening right now. Situations could go worse as time goes by. The market cannot recover easily as the operations of companies cannot go back to normal. As superstitions in the early days say that in the future, the world will fall deep and a new world will rise. It is clear that coronavirus has resulted in a bad economic impact. As the nations are battling with Covid-19, livelihoods and businesses are much affected. Shares in stocks are being sold hoping to save the losses before it goes worse. Commodities and markets crashed. Travel restrictions and lockdowns are everywhere. Everything is happening for the first time in history.\nBut based on Shane's research, studies show that emerging technologies can resolve the issues of operations today. For instance, the internet is a great tool for communication and engagement. There are other useful technologies as well, such as AI and Blockchain. These technologies are very useful in developing solutions for any application.\nHowever, with the current situation of staying at home for most individuals, as schools as well were being suspended, Shane thinks that there is a high rate of effectivity in using these technologies. And mass adoption can be gained if the people or community is supported by their needs. Resources is limited and not everyone has access to the internet.\nGo to the Arbitrable Application",

As they fear using the platform in sharing private information to shop online.\nThe Solution\nIn able to solve this problem, the shopping company would only ask the customers to pay half of the total amount and pay the remaining upon receiving the delivery. So the company looked for a partnership with a reliable delivery company. They made an agreement to collect the customer\u2019s remaining payment on behalf of the latter. They added another payment option which is COD or \u201cCash On Delivery\u201d for half of the remaining payment.\nTo take effect, on behalf of the customer the logistics company pays the store owner in advance with 3% off as part of the agreement. And then notifies the customers to prepare the payment ahead of time before the delivery schedule. They can then take the amount collected in every shipment with an extra charge for the delivery fee.\nGo to the Arbitrable Application",

        "description": "Greg lost his staked ETH on a blockchain-based horse race betting website which was fed external data through blockchain oracle. He has claimed that he along with 4 others had staked 0.5 ETH individually to answer the question about which horse won the local horse racing event. However, Greg was penalized and his ETH stake was forfeited & distributed to the other 4 respondents as his response was different from the other 4 respondents.\nGreg claims that he accessed the information about the winning horse through a third-party blog owned by a city-based resident and this blog had provided an incorrect answer about the winning horse. Hence, Greg believes that he shouldn't be penalized for the wrong information as he wasn't the one who was responsible for the incorrect answer. Greg holds the blog owner responsible for the incorrect information and he wants the gambling website to refund him his 0.5 ETH.\nGo to the Arbitrable Application",

He did his research on Instagram & approached multiple influencers. After reaching out to many influencers, Robert finalized Alex for promoting Robert\u2019s new brand of protein bars as Alex seemed to be the most cost-effective option for Robert.\nRobert finalized the deal with Alex through verbal communication and they agreed that Robert will keep the agreed amount of 5 ETH in Kleros escrow and Alex would be paid after Alex posts 3 promotional images about Robert\u2019s new brand of protein bars on his Instagram account. However, Robert did not agree to transfer the agreed amount of ETH even after Alex had posted 3 promotional images about Robert\u2019s new brand of protein bars on his Instagram account. Robert believes that the content promoting his products did not garner enough likes & shares as the likes & shares that were received on content promoting his products were comparatively lesser than Alex\u2019s previous posts. On another hand, Alex is saying that there was no communication from his end to assure Robert that the content promoting Robert\u2019s products would receive any minimum number of likes & shares and the only promise made by Alex was to post three promotional images about Robert\u2019s new brand of protein bars.\nGo to the Arbitrable Application",

However, it was gathered that at the end of the campaign, token B has more supporters as revealed by Mossex voting chart, but the result of the vote showed that token A has the higher number of votes. From investigation, token B team has alleged that Mossex has granted token A (being their preferred) an exclusive privilege that allows their team and supporters vote multiple times such that even though they have low number of supporters, they have higher number of votes.

Let's imagine for a second that the rule meant that the blank space is part of the logo, this introduces a contradiction: if a token symbol's ratio is less than 1:2 (ex: 99x200 px), the token will then by definition will never pass the TCR, as it won't fulfill the \"take most of the space available in the image\" criterion (99x200 px is less than 50% of 200x200 px).

In the real court the judge, if a procedural error, like this one, was discovered, would give the responsible party a chance to correct the deficiency, simply because the quality of the logo has nothing to do with the concept of ERC20 token. So a better way for this court to work is to allow the submitter to resolve some problems (image quality, typos, etc.) during some grace period.\n\nThe problem with our submission was because of the fact that our original logo is in SVG format, a format that all modern browsers support, a format that is scalable to any size without quality loss. But this court only accepts PNG images, so we had to convert it and default converter parameters resulted in this small image. But again, why wouldn't the software alert the submitters about the small image size? It's probably one line of code, and it does look like a loophole for challengers to make a quick buck. One line of code would have prevented this situation. The 200px should never have been a rule for humans to follow, but for computers to automatically enforce.

That's the name used on the official website zb.com \u201d\nEvidence was presented, first with a chat on the ZB.com page and then with his telegram group where it is more than clear that they talk about the token as ZB Token. The jurors confuses the name of the Exchange (zb.com) with that of the Token. You can go to the page and see what they call it: https://www.zb.com/activity/zbecology. \n2) \u201cbut also the names used on most coin aggregators (coinmarketcap and coingecko)\u201d\nSeriously? I can't believe it. In the initial evidence presented by myself, I said that more than 20 pages where the name used is ZB TOKEN. He even uses evidence that denies him when naming coingecko since you can see with your own eyes that there the name is ZB TOKEN: https://www.coingecko.com/en/coins/zb-token where it says:\nZB Token (ZB)\nZB Token (ZB) is a cryptocurrency token issued on the Ethereum platform. ZB Token (ZB) price for today is $ 0.194584 [\u2026]. The most active exchange that is trading ZB Token is ZBG. Explore the address and transactions of ZB Token on block explorers such as etherscan.io, ethplorer.io, and enjinx.io. Additional information about ZB Token coin can be found at https://www.zb.com/.\n3) \u201cThe name should be the most commonly used name to refer to the asset. It does not necessarily need to be the official name given by project creators nor the one in the token contract \u201d.\nThis is something that contradicts the first part of his presentation and at the same time leaves him exposed since I have clearly demonstrated that the most used name by the community refer to the asset is clearly and without a doubt ZB Token.\n4) \u201cSuffixes such as, but not limited to:\u201c Token \u201d,\u201c Coin \u201dshould generally be avoided, unless a name with suffix is already well established\u201d\nA little more of the same, the suffix Token in the name ZB Token is more than well established and accepted by the user community of the different Exchanges, blockchains and cryptocurrencies\nFor all the above, I ask the jurors of the second round to please review the evidence sent since this will surely make them see the right side where justice should be."

However, in the token's description (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/zb/), under the title About ZB, it textually says \"ZB Token (ZB) is an exchange token and the native currency of the ZB.COM crypto exchange. The ZB can be used to purchase monthly VIP status plans for transaction fee discounts, vote on exchange decisions, gain early access to special ZB launchpad events, receive crypto rewards from seasonal buybacks, and trade with other cryptocurrencies listed on the ZB exchange.\"\nNote that the description of other tokes, for example the Kleros one (https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/kleros/), says \"Kleros (PNK) is a cryptocurrency token and operates...\", not including the term Token after the name. \nBased in this evidence, we believe that also for coinmarketcap.com the name of the token is \"ZB Token\", being the ZB (ZB) expression used in the title of the corresponding webpage an error by omission that eventually should be corrected."

They regard my own impartiality and my application of Criterion 1.1.5.\n\n(2) First, even if there was an interested juror on the jury, this would have no effect. Kleros is designed to motivate every juror to vote honestly and penalises those who don\u2019t. Therefore, there is no remedy for the parties if a juror is not neutral except for a chance to win an appeal.\n\n(3) Citing precedent does not imply bias. I was citing my own previous judgement in which I explain what standard of evidence applies for Criterion 1.1.5. By citing it I could avoid to spell everything out again. But even citing an opinion by another juror could not be considered bias as it shows, that the legal opinion backed by the precedent is shared by other jurors as well. This increases its legitimacy in a way and makes the application of ambiguous clauses more foreseeable to both parties.\n\n(4) I see no reason to refuse to arbitrate. The subcriteria of Criterion 1.1. shall allow jurors who - in this court - have a technical background to filter out certain types of Tokens that are likely securities under Swiss law. As Criterion 1.1. explicitly states failing one of the subcriteria implies being a security under Swiss Law. This is a legal fiction that applies even if the token is, in fact, not a security.\n\n(5) It is also not unlawful to apply Criterion 1.1.5 even if it has nothing to do with a Swiss regulation. When applying for the badge the Submitter is presented the primary document. By submitting the application they enter into an arbitration agreement which says that they can loose the dispute if they fail to meet Criterion 1.1.5. I discourage juror\u2019s from refusing to apply a clause from the arbitration agreement that the parties entered into voluntarily.\n\n(6) In some way this argument is similar to the argument about Intellectual Property the Submitter made. Even if there is no way that effective control over the project could imply the token to be considered a security under Swiss law this does not mean that an agreement between the parties that establishes this fiction would become unlawful.

A failure to fulfill this criterion by the requester should result in a badge denial. The requester mentioned that \"effective control\" is vague and is subject to many different interpretations, but that is not the case. To quote the policy: \"Reject if: The project currently needs a 'coordinator node' controlled by the issuer to work. There is no plan of replacing this coordinator node\". Juror #1 mentions it in his judgment document (D.14-D.16): the utility of PCL token is directly linked to the closed engine the Peculium team holds. As long as this engine remains \"closed\" and no plan to open source it is available, the team has \"effective control\" on the project. Contrast it to projects like Ethereum, MakerDAO, or Kleros where each teams pledged to reduce influence on their respective project and the main utility of each token still persists."

When applying for a badge you agree to these terms and they are presented to you as a very first step after you click on the \"add badge\" button. Apart from that 1.1.5 is an example of when a Token is to be considered a security under Swiss Law. Without any change in Swiss legislation a violation of 1.1.5 of \"the old criteria\" constitutes a violation of 1.1 which is still part of the new criteria.\n(3) The rule is also applicable despite the project being protected as intellectual property. Intellectual property does not allow you to simply avoid terms you have previously agreed to. IP being protected means that the property owner can prevent others from using their idea. It does not prevent them from disadvantages resulting from the non-disclosure of information. In fact, the  point of property is that you can give it up in order for some other gain. Therefore 1.1.5 is applicable and PCL cannot comply with it."

They have not been distributed on-chain but instead sit on Bitrex in wallets controlled by Spend. We cannot just take their word that all of the tokens have been distributed.\n\nI did not raise point 2.2. I argued 2.1 originally, because the transactions moving funds to Bitrex looked like foul play. I think it is fair to say that, while they do remain suspicious to me for many reasons I have pointed out and juror 2 also pointed out, they have a reasonable enough explanation that I can withdraw this claim. I have no serious proof they are improper persons and it is quite a serious charge.\n\nOn 3.1, a summary of my argument is as follows. 3.1.1: The Spend App is not a beta product for Spendcoin. It is all offchain and does not use any properties of the token, nor does it ever intend to. The app can be used normally without owning any Spendcoin. There are some ways you can use Spendcoin for extra benefits but it is not a real use of the token, just marketing to get people to buy and hold it. A beta product for Spendcoin would be Spendchain which does not have a beta version.\n3.1.2: They recently open sourced some code but there is very little original code written so far. It is mostly just a fork of Cosmos.\n3.1.3: The whitepaper for Spendchain presents no novel uses of cryptography or mathematics. The token most certainly has no novel uses of cryptography or mathematics as it is not even used on chain."

The token has plenty of present day utility to stake for services and in the future when\nSpendchain launches to run Settlement, Merchant, and Validator nodes as well as\ngoverance voting of the network.\n2. Spendchaind and Spend.com all have novel technology that is in a niche market with\nlow number of competitors as in comparison to other niches.\n3. Spend App does require Spendcoins to use the higher tier services. Spendchain is a\nCosmos SDK and Tendermint based blockchain that will be highly customized in its road\nmap of features and whitepaper (https://spend.org/roadmap)\n4. The economic benefits are highly sustainable. The challenger doesn\u2019t understand\nInterchange and Merchant Rewards networks which is how Spend will operate after the\ndistribution incentive runs out (see ebates.com)\n5. Spend fully passes all securities law frameworks. It is listed on the Bittrex USD market\nand USA market which required extensive legal opinion about the framework of the\ntoken. The token never held an ICO and was launched when utility was available for\nimmediate use. Once Spendchain launches there will no central control.

It is still in the primary document so there has been no policy change. Complying with U. S. legal standards does not necessary mean that Swiss standards are met. There are very different approaches when it comes to defining \"security\", as the different treatment of crypto currency in Europe and the U. S. shows. Furthermore, when 1.1.5 implied being a security under Swiss law before it still does unless legislation in Switzerland has changed. Switzerland is planning to deregulate blockchain but has not done so yet. Therefore, I will consider compliance with Rule 1.1.5 in my final judgement."

The highest 41 Validators based on Vote Weight are able to secure the network. They do not need KYC to become Validators. \n\nSo to answer your questions:   1) Yes Anyone can be a Validator by vote. There is NO KYC required.  2) Vote takes place on-chain by either the node CLI or web client/wallet. These vote weights are in real time so if user wants to remove their vote and give it someone else they may do so by their address and vote command. \n\nThank you.

Then we will respond to the video given by Baer Chain as a counter\nargument. Finally the document will repeat previous arguments for some context.\nMain argument\nFake social media profile and lack of public presence (enough to deny the badge): We tried to find\ninformation about Scott Bingley, there is little to find, google images does provide only 2 or 3 profile\npictures, all related to baer chain. No conferences, no team pictures, which is very unlikely for the\nCTO of a highly technical project. (lack of public presence)\nNow we take look at the linkedIn profile : https://www.linkedin.com/in/scott-bingley/ which is the\nonly profile related with Scott Bingley on social networks. (lack of public presence).\n\nThe CTO of Baerchain is an oursourced CTO to support the project.\n\nBaerchain has also an inhouse CTO. \n\nnone of the team members is using any fake profile and honestly it is really a bit hard to have the Baerchain badge permanently denied even the evidence already was given that Mr. Scott is oursourced.\n\nplease specify the first part of your 2.1 challenge more clear if this is also related to the CEO of Baerchain?"

Perhaps these inconsistencies are my own error (e.g. Airswap) but there still seem to be Tokens with similar audit situations to GRID.  Your analogy of a crime is great. If I commit a crime and the statute of limitations has not expired, then I will still be prosecuted. This idea is central to a TCR. The registry is not finalized when items make it on. They are continuously curated based on the rulings of the community, in this case Kleros.  I am not saying set the precedence of making the crime legal. I am saying set the precedence to retroactively make the TCR better.  I don\u2019t agree with a lot of arguments on here but I will respect them if they are enforced equitably on the TCR. Rule how you see fit. If this is a case where jurors believe that GRID has no 3rd party audit, then don\u2019t pass it.

I hope that both sides read this and think about it carefully. Typically arbitrators do not set precedence however, there is an emerging literature on when they do. One key time is when they are \u201clikely to be viewed as legitimate producers of law within the relevant context\u201d (weidamaier 2009). It is clear here that you as jurors are creating precedence for the Kleros TCR. I obviously disagree with the current arguments about GRID and Diligence not being 3rd parties, however let\u2019s pretend that I solely relied on your precedence instead of my interpretations. Looking at other Tokens I would see Airswap and Gnosis in the TCR. So even if I had misgivings about GRID in terms of 4.1, I would have applied because you have let in multiple projects. Furthermore, during the time of audit neither Gnosis nor Airswap had spun off from ConsenSys. So they are even more suspect than GRID according to your test. Many if not all of you were staked as jurors when Gnosis and Airswap were accepted. Therefore, Gnosis and Airswap did not sneak past you like the cat in Doge on Trial, these were clear submissions you decided to let in. Now that you have concluded that GRID is not a third-party none of you have taken the step to remove Airswap or Gnosis. Why? If you feel so strongly that you are correct there is both economic incentive and altruistic incentive for you to do so. For the requestor in this case, the Kleros community signaled that GRID passed 4.1 through Airswap and Gnosis. Things change, I get that but you are doing nothing to remove that signal. People will see Airswap and Gnosis and assume these projects fulfill the guidelines. Do you see how this creates an opaque and frustrating process for new requesters? There should be some continuity about how guidelines are interpreted across submissions. Right now it seems like you are judging each token differently and there is no clear test. I\u2019m not saying you \u201cmust let GRID pass,\u201d but I do think something should be done. Perhaps one of you should remove Airswap and Gnosis. If guidelines are inconsistently applied why would anyone trust that they would get a fair outcome using TC2R?"

We emailed Gon\u00e7alo again several days ago but have not heard back. I imagine being stuck in the middle of an internet argument calling into question his professional ethics and diligence has exhausted his patience. Marc Zeller has written to him on Twitter, I suggest you do the same, perhaps you will have better luck getting him to publish his company\u2019s accounting records. Regarding your questions, you already know the answers as Gon\u00e7alo provided them to you in the first round. You know that Gon\u00e7alo attested to conducting the audit and that GridPlus is a totally separate company. Our point was that regardless of whether or not you change your core belief that we should be using public data, the evidence previously submitted demonstrates Gon\u00e7alo S\u00e1 is a third-party auditor by all definitions of that word used in the auditing industry. Either way, even though the evidence provided shows compliance far in excess of many of the coins approved by this process so far, you, the challengers were allocated 13 of 23 juror slots in this round. The evidence and merit of our arguments don\u2019t matter as you would never change your vote anyways because you are financially incentivized to protect your staked PNK and the ether you put up for the challenge. You personally drew at least 7 of the 23 slots.

To be clear, DGX does not violate 1.1.4 of the policy because the initial price of DGX wasn\u2019t expected to for instance double after the ICO. That would only happen if the price of gold would double, as buying DGX is basically like buying gold. The redeemable value of GRID tokens however was between 770% and 1567% than the initial token price (according to the example in the GridPlus whitepaper). Moreover, what the co-founder of Ethfinex is tweeting is completely irrelevant. The listing process has been made decentralized for a reason, Ethfinex co-founders have no say whatsoever in Kleros and its ecosystem. In fact, Ethfinex is the one who provided us (the challengers, appeal funders and jurors) with a policy on which we should rule. If they don\u2019t agree with the ruling of the first round, they should have created different policy rules. Or they can update the policy to make it more fitting to their desires, so that GridPlus will become compliant with the policy at the next time of submission . For instance change it so that a security audit does not have to be performed by a third-party anymore.

One might think that because of that reason the token price could possibly also rise incredibly much. Furthermore, you can\u2019t compare paper coupons with GRID tokens, as paper coupons aren\u2019t traded on exchanges like GRID tokens are. To react to 1.1.5, the clause that I quoted from the whitepaper definitely states that Grid+ controls the limits of redeemable GRID tokens - These exact limits are set by Grid+ and are functions of the total number of Grid+ customers and revenue in the given region.\u201d - As you can read, the exact limits are set by Grid+ (violation of 1.1.5) and these limits depend on the number of customers and revenue.

If Coinbase limits your daily ether deposits and withdrawals does that mean they have retained centralized control of Ethereum? No, it clearly does not and in much the same way no entity is capable of exercising control over how GRID is used.

                "description": "This challenger\u2019s newest approach, as is common with many disputes that go to arbitration, is over interpretation. However, if their interpretation is correct most tokens listed on Ethfinex today, whether vetted via Kleros or the exchange itself, would not qualify. Their focus is on dissecting the definition of words rather than executing the guidance provided by Ethfinex in order to meet the exchange\u2019s goals. The code underwent audit to ensure that it was safe to deploy and the criterion in question explicitly refers to \u201ctradability\u201d. Indeed, GRID has been freely circulating and trading for the better part of two years. The most recently posted PDF from the challenger listed many things that we obviously don\u2019t disagree with such as the fact that the Grid+ founders worked at ConsenSys. This doesn\u2019t prove their point nor does the challenger define a bright line test for what does or does not meet their personal criteria. In this circumstance we have an independent company that received a code audit from a team that was also funded by the same venture studio. ConsenSys defines itself as a \u201cMesh of quasi independent, loosely coupled orgs.\u201d So, in this circumstance the challenger believes that because Grid+ shared venture backing with ConsenSys Diligence then that\u2019s not a third party. However, if you apply this metric then Zeppelin Solutions which was cited in the guidance would be disqualified from providing many audits due to identical complications. For example, Status (SNT) is listed on Ethfinex but both are Fabric Ventures portfolio companies. Gnosis and FOAM were audited by ConsenSys Diligence while still in the ConsenSys mesh which makes GRID far more compliant since it is a separate company. Ultimately the challenger here is attempting to apply a standard that they themselves have not even defined: there is no metric provided to define passing or failing their personal interpretation of what constitutes a third party. Ethfinex and Kleros both demonstrate precedence that firmly rejects the challenger\u2019s assertion that sharing an investor invalidates a token audit. This attempt to hold GRID to a standard not previously applied by the exchange or the court fails to demonstrate that ConsenSys Diligence was in any way unfit to review deployed contract in question."

The audit requirement in the listing criteria is for the token itself, not the entire project. Kleros Court Guidelines place this criterion under the category \u201cTradability\u201d and its stated purpose is that the audit deems the token code safe.  Your statement also contains several misconceptions regarding Grid+: it does not employ a proof-of-location system, it will not create a decentralized oracle for wholesale price feeds, and the BOLT stablecoin was long ago deprecated. Finally, GRID represents a consumer right that cannot be expressed via a fixed dollar amount. Grid+ will not buy back tokens and has made no such claim. The consumer right conveyed via GRID ownership can be exercised through GridPlus Energy, Rynergy, and the other electricity retailers that will implement this system. No company that is implementing the Grid+ software stack has offered (let alone guaranteed) to pay or repay users that redeem coins. They are not exchangeable with these companies for any fiat currency. Regarding the audit, we have demonstrated that Grid+ posted public notification of the audit prior to the token sale along with a link to the code.

Instead of a literal buy back of tokens with fiat, GRID can be redeemed to remove the markup on electricity (1 GRID removes markup of 500 kwh). This is still a buy back, because the holder can hand in his GRID and in return he gets a discount of a specific amount of dollars. Reason number 3: We\u2019ve seen that evidence submitted show that no proof of a third party audit existed at the time of submission (and still doesn\u2019t, as ConsenSys doesn\u2019t seem to be a third party to me.)

An internal security audit is obviously not enough to comply to the criteria, and is wrongly stated. We're sure jurors agree to this. It's bad practice to wrongly interpret rules trying to further a cause like this. He is also bringing up (again) the email as evidence.

                "description": "Jurors this post clearly demonstrates that 4.1 is fulfilled. First, let us dissect the TERMS: \u201cThe token has passed a third-party review or security audit that deems it as safe, or be using a well-known audited framework (such as OpenZeppelin) without changes. Accept if: The token has been audited by Trail of Bits.\u201d Arguments set forth by the challenger and by third party responses set out to conflate these terms. Looking at them it is evident that in no place is \u201cpublic\u201d a requirement. Furthermore, look at the use of \u201cor\u201d in the terms. The use of \u201cor\u201d instead of \u201cand\u201d provides three ways that 4.1 can be fulfilled. Consensys diligence does not need to be a \u201cthird-party\u201d as the challenger states because 4.1 is fulfilled by the second clause: \u201cSecurity audit that deems it safe.\u201d Not by the first clause: \u201chas passed a third-party review.\u201d GRID has actually fulfilled 4.1 in the safest way possible because of the three clauses, under-going a security audit is the most rigorous. Remember this fact: security audits are more rigorous than third party reviews when we look at context. Let us now look at CONTEXT. It is fact that 4.1 is categorized under Tradability. The purpose of all of category 4 is to ensure that once listed on Ethfinex the token can be tradable. We can see that clauses 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 also ensure tradability. A passed security audit public or not public ensures that the token is tradeable. If you interpret that the audit must be public you are doing so because you are trying to make this process equitable. This is not about an equitable process. This is not about the challenger getting a \u201cfair chance,\u201d this is about the criteria for listing a token. Finally, let\u2019s look at the EVIDENCE: Evidence has been submitted that the code was audited and the public was told about the audit. This is in the form of a public blog post from 2017 and in the form of an email from the auditor Gon\u00e7alo S\u00e1. In conclusion we have walked you through how GRID fulfills all of these: the Terms, the Context, and the Evidence of 4.1. The Challenger and third parties have not laid out how GRID does not fulfill 4.1. They instead are trying to persuade your interpretation of 4.1 by using conjecture, by using conflation of the three clauses of  4.1, by playing on your empathy that this process should be equitable, and by calling into question the validity of evidence (i.e. the word of the actual auditor).

We haven't done deep research whether or not these comply to the criterias, but if they don't have an audit publicly available by a third party they should also be removed. We think why Gnosis and Airswap wasn't challenged was because they applied really early and people weren't into the policy yet. There is not enough economic incentive to remove any of them at the moment. We saw the same thing with Pinakion (PNK) in the T2CR. Presedence proved it should be removed, still it took a long time before someone did it.

                "description": "We now agree that it\u2019s clear the single commit in question was audited. We know that the criterion in question requires that code be audited. It does not require an audit report. When dealing with smart contracts it\u2019s very important that everything be reviewed carefully, but it would also be very unusual for an audit report to be issued for a single commit. So the requirement is fulfilled, but that brings us to the broader topic of what constitutes fairness in the context of Kleros. How could the public know whether that commit was audited or not before challenging? Community moderator Tobias already showed us this answer. When the Grid+ supporters applied for the listing badge Tobias quickly joined the official Grid+ Telegram and began asking questions and requesting resources to satisfy his inquiries. The Grid+ cofounders gladly complied! That is a legitimate and easily accessible means of ascertaining the required information. The two people that reviewed the code (Gon\u00e7alo S\u00e1 and Mike Goldin, the creator of TCRs as we know them)  offered to provide any evidence jurors required to prove the provenance of their attestation about the audit \u2013 a tweet, Github comment, etc. but the challenger declined while still saying we cannot prove the provenance of Gon\u00e7alo\u2019s email. So the challenger had a means of obtaining this information before issuing the challenge that other Kleros community members were aware of but did not take advantage of it. And when offered the opportunity to verify this information, they opted not to take it. And if we are concerned with matters beyond the Ethfinex Listing Criteria then why isn\u2019t this same logic applied in defense of the requestors? If the Kleros Court Guidance does not require an audit report how could they possibly know that there was an expectation of one? The difference here is that the challenger had easy access to this information but did not do the simplest form of due diligence which is asking a question. Asking a question was the very first thing other Kleros community members did when they began their research which proves that it is the logical and obvious choice when deciding whether or not to issue a challenge. With this topic we are ultimately debating something that is not part of Kleros Court Guidance and even from that perspective the challenger had an opportunity to obtain this information but opted not to."

                "description": "Jurors this post clearly demonstrates two reasons why GRID has utility. In doing this we will need to talk about how providers of electricity (i.e. utility companies) gain market share in Texas. To avoid confusion when referring to a utility company we will capitalize UTILITY whereas when referring to the GRID token, utility will remain lower case. REASON 1 -  In Texas it is common practice for UTILITIES to offer coupons to reduce prices and acquire customers. These are commonly called \u201cbill credits,\u201d you can see the use of such coupons here (some plans advertise \u201cw/ bill credit\u201d: https://www.texaselectricityratings.com/electricity-rates). GRID is one of these coupons on blockchain. This solves two problems A) double spending and B) predatory practices of UTILITIES for how they can use \u201cbill credits\u201d (see this blog post: https://electricityplans.com/detect-teaser-electricity-rates/). Finally, all of these coupons including GRID cost the UTILITY money. Texas is a deregulated market and all electricity must be bought at auction. It is impossible to reduce that price. Therefore, GRID and all other coupons reduce the margin on electricity. GRID+ the UTILITY is losing $2-$3 per a GRID redeemed (ICO price $1.15 vs. current discount for customer $3-$5 depending on plan). You can see here that customers in Texas are redeeming: https://gridplus.io/grid-token It is therefore impossible for the main purpose of GRID to be fundraising if every redemption costs the company more than what they sold it for. REASON 2 - The challenger admits in evidence that the following clauses are satisfied: \u201cThere is a demand for the token driven by an existing or future utility. This utility is obtained from obtaining, holding, participating, or spending the token.\" It is impossible for the third clause to be unsatisfied if the first two are satisfied. The third clause here gives allowances for tokens that have had an ICO but for which the utility is not yet available. Literally all that is needed to fulfill clause three of 3.2 is an \u201cidentified reason\u201d for utility. GRID does that in the whitepaper. Since GRID is being redeemed this clause is fulfilled. "

However, they clearly lay out in the white paper a PLAN to relinquish control of this power and to decentralize it. Their plan for doing this is to make a secure piece of connected hardware. This hardware would remove their control of the process by doing the following: hardware reads real-time smart meter energy use, hardware reads real-time ERCOT energy prices, hardware securely stores crypto-currency including ERC-20 tokens, hardware can run Dapps, the hardware then runs a Dapp which always ensures the consumer can buy energy when they want at auction and that the consumer can always redeem GRID. They are effectively creating a decentralized network of hardware that purchases energy through their legal entity (i.e. the utility) in Texas. They will have no control over how customers buy energy or redeem GRID on this layer. There is the risk that their legal entity could go out of business or be stopped by some regulatory framework. This risk is being mitigated by licensing this structure to other utilities. See this blog post: https://blog.gridplus.io/gridplus-explores-international-expansion-8f97ec84b014\nHowever, this risk is not centralization. In summary,  while there is a centralized legal entity (i.e. a utility) for regulatory purposes, the redemption of GRID and the customers access to the market will be decentralized. They have made significant steps towards this plan. The hardware (i.e. the Lattice1) is in pre-sale now and will deployed in September."

Utility customers in Texas are currently redeeming the token for a discount on electricity. You can see that 48,000 tokens have been redeemed here https://gridplus.io/grid-token. You can also inspect the redemption contract there.\n\nGRID is not a discount on 500 kWh of electricity but a discount on the margin on 500 kWh of electricity. In Texas all utilities buy electricity at auction and then put a mark-up on what was purchased at auction. This mark-up covers their costs (e.g. administrative , marketing) and gives the utility profit. GRID is used to reduce the cost of that mark-up. GRID was sold not to primarily raise funds (there are majority holders in the Grid company whom invested without buying at the public ICO) but as a device to put these utility coupons onto the market so that when the utility went live they could acquire customers more cheaply than other utilities. Marketing is discussed in the white paper. This plan is working. They are getting 250+ new utility customers a week without marketing and customers are redeeming GRID.\n\nGrid is a US based company. They worked diligently with the legal team at consensys to ensure that the GRID token was a utility token because of the SEC. Their utility use case passed muster with the SEC and they have not been subpoenaed like many other US companies that did token sales in 2017-2018. "

We cannot consider the requirement to get a security review or an audit satisfied if there is not public statement about it. So I'd tend not to consider it satisfied.\n\nOn point 4.2, we can see on etherscan the contract which created the Grid+ Token, it includes the code of the token, so we can easily know its code even if the code is not verified on etherscan. Having code verified on etherscan is an example and this point can be satisfied in other ways.\n\nOn point 3.2, even if the token may have a utility (serve as a coupon), this is not enough, we need the team to have identified a reason for the token to exist. It does not mean this reason should be valid, but it should be there. What is the reason GRID was created in the first place? I still fail to see it and I'm undecided on this point.\n\nOn 1.1.5, I don't think being a coupon prevents from being a security so I would reject the argument that 1.1.5 does not apply because 1.1 is satisfied. However, 1.1.5 only asks if there is a plan, not if this plan is realistic. Having a plan for more energy providers accepting those coupons would decentralize the project, so I'd tend to see this point as fulfilled."

Otherwise almost no token would satisfy this and it would not be a good criteria.\n\nOn the time of submission, I'd tend to have a more nuanced view. The challenger refers to the SpaceChain jurisprudence but it was based on a rule formulated quite differently \"The team which issued the token should have made efforts to be transparent about details of the token supply, circulating supply, and any inflation, as well as\ntheir own ownership of issued tokens.\". In the SpaceChain, efforts to be transparent were required. While here, I would rule just on whether the information was accessible by a party which would make some efforts to understand it.\n\nHaving the code uploaded on etherscan is not a request, that's an example of how the code would be open source. If the code is open source and I can verify it myself with the information at the time of the submission, I would consider this point valid.\n\nSame for the audit/review, if the information exists (even on Github, not necessarily as a communication material) that Gonsalo reviewed the changes I'd tend to view the point as accepted."

On top of that I also refute the claim that the TCR is meant to be permanently, as the developers implemented the \"Remove Token\" function for a reason."

Website of the ZRX token is not zrx.org, but the project name instead: 0x.org. The website of this token is keplertek.io. Kepler seems to be the overarching name of the project.

The issue was it was hard to find. And once the challenger pointed this out they cleared it up. This seems like good faith on both sides. It would be nice if there was a time period where the challenger could withdraw if the submitter shows they fulfill all points. As this is not possible we should go with, as the challenger says, if the project violated the terms at the time of challenge. It seems to me they did not violate the terms. The information was available even if the challenger didn't see it. I don't think either side should lose money in this dispute, however the purpose is whether the project should get the badge or not, and it seems to me they should. So again I vote yes"

This would make challenging really risky, discourage challenger and let almost any token go though.\n-This would also be an attack on jurors, as jurors would vote according to a initial state of the word but appeal jurors would vote on a different one.

A single malicious juror colluding with the submitter could then vote one way knowing the state of the world would be changed after appeal and get large amount of PNK from honest jurors.\n\nThis case is clearly the most important and dangerous that Kleros has ever seen and I would not be surprised that it could even result to a fork would the jurors accept the badge."
